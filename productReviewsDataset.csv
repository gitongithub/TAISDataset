"I used to be an avid fan of the Harmony Remote (I've owned several in the past), but that is no longer the case. Our Ultimate One seemed to work fine at first, and we were pleased. But over time, we've become less and less satisfied. Something changed over time, and now EVERY time we start an Activity, we need to go to the Fix it myself function because there is always one problem or another with one of the devices. Also, the response time of the devices is MUCH slower with the Harmony than when using the the remote that comes with the device. So, for example, when you press the Play/Pause button during a Fast Forward, it takes about 3 seconds to respond, which forces you to have to Rewind, which is then also delayed when you try to stop it. Usually, we just end up giving up. There is also a problem with the over-sensitive recognition of gestures, which causes things to happen when we don't want them to, and therefore must be undone. It has become a frustration to use the Harmony remote, and we frequently end up just using the remotes that came with the devices. Sort of defeats the purpose, don't you think Especially when you consider the cost of this product. We tried to re-sync the Harmony Remote to see if that would correct some of the issues we're having. At first the sync ran for hours without completing. The message on the remote said not to disconnect because it was in the middle of an update, but we finally disconnected/reconnected the remote, and the sync finally finished. But, much to our disappointment, all of the problems are still there. The only thing we can think of doing now is to delete all of our devices and activities and re-enter them. Since this is time-consuming, and should be unnecessary, it only adds to the frustration. This is not the kind of PR Logitech should want for its product.",1
Very good computer. It replaced an old one. It is smaller than the old one with more memory,1
"Apple CarPlay is here and it's clean interface is what is going to attract many buyers. I do enjoy the fast and simple interface that functions almost exactly as any Apple product many have come to know. It is the sole reason I personally purchased the deck and overall am quite pleased with it. It is super basic which is understandable to keep the driver's eyes on the road and not the display. For music it's a home run and for navigation it's a bit of a disappointment. There is NO Bluetooth connectivity which is a bit of a bummer and the phone mirrors the app on the screen which is a negative in my opinion. Alpine quality is there, but it's far from perfect.",1
"Love, love, love the Harmony Universal Remote. Now I don't have to fiddle with the various remotes, from my television, sound bar, blue ray player, cable company. That's right - 4 remotes that I would have had to deal with had I not gotten a universal remote. It makes using my entertainment system so much easier. The universal remote is quite simple to use, once you get the hang of the touch screen. What is really nice on it is the ""help"" function, which asks you a series of simple questions if for some reason things go awry. In other words, the device is essentially self-correcting.",1
Purchased and received within one week. Purchased to replace television recent purchased that had to be returned for sound issues. Easy to set up. Picture is great. Sound is good. Very pleased overall.,1
I have not hooked up the Ultimate Ears - MEGABLAST Smart Portable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Speaker. I purchased for the Amazon Alexa Voice Assistant ...,1
These are very good quality tapes at a very reasonable price.,1
I need a keyboard for my tablet. And this with the finger print makes my life so much easier.,1
"Fast, simple installation. Performs exactly as expected. Powerful enough that I have not lost connectivity even once. Highly recommend.",1
Decent ram stick for beginners who build their own computers,1
Easy to use sounds great!! Lightweight and easy to take to soccer practice!,1
"I love satellite radio, but I wish it wasn't so much money. There are a lot of garbage on the radio anymore. I spend a lot of time driving. if I didn't have satellite radio I would go nuts....",1
"This remote is the best purchase I have made. It's ease of use, and I don't have to have 5 remote controls anymore!",1
WOW! I wasn't expecting such a great picture. Easy to set up. Intuitive remote and screen. This was to replace an older Samsung that went off to college. The new design of the base makes it very stable. And WOW what a picture. I read reviews about having to adjust due to the ambient light sensor. But mine's in a dimly lit room and I didn't need to adjust any of the settings.,1
Speaker was easy to install. They sound amazing around my patio and pool. Great buy!,1
"The fingerprint reader was a cool option, but my reason was that this is a bit stronger than the original keyboard. I like the surface, but typing mobile has been a pain. This helps.",1
"This was an upgrade from my current Surface 2 Pro. The difference is obvious, the keys feel great and responsive. A bit expensive but the surface is not cheap either. Highly recommend it.",1
Already own a Sony blue tooth speaker so that's why I thought it would be the perfect gift as a housewarming gift for a friend who has a pool and needed some sound on their patio,1
I bought this for my daughter she loves it she can listen to her music and it's comfortable to wear,1
I really like the tv but the base is so wide I had to rearrange my furniture.,1
"I never thought I could get excited over a remote control, but I did with this one. First of all, let me state that I was on the fence after reading the reviews here on Amazon, but I took the plunge and so far I'm not regretting it. This is my first Harmony remote, so I obviously can't make comparisons with previous models which might have been better than the unit presently under review.It took me 30 to 45 minutes to set up and sync my new remote through the Harmony software. That was a breeze, but it's important that you know your system and how its individual components are connected to each other. All my components were supported by the remote, so no problems there. I was able to customize the background image on the touchscreen. A nice touch, though not very important.Once the first sync from software to remote is completed, the remote will work on your system. As opposed to the previous situation, where you had four remotes lying around, you will now hit one button ('activity') and your TV, AV receiver and third component will turn on all at once. Great! At first this does not work flawlessly. For instance, you hit 'Watch TV' and everything might come on, but the AV receiver won't be on the right channel. The great thing about this remote, though, is that it learns on the job: It will ask you if the function performed as desired, and if not, how it can improve. After my initial use with every component, these flaws were pretty much ironed out. I now have a perfect remote with no issues whatsoever.One downside to all this automation is that the Harmony cannot predict when you've been fooling around with your equipment behind its back. Turned off your TV by hand using that device's own power button The Harmony doesn't know, so when you switch everything off through the remote (again: just ONE button), your TV will come back on again. You can work around this by customizing the color buttons on the bottom of the remote to be separate power on/off buttons for the individual components. You'll need to customize these buttons for every programmed activity, so there's an initial time investment involved. And of course there are no markings for these functions on the remote, so you'll have to memorize everything. All in all this is not ideal.If you want to nitpick, a few other minor cons are: 1) the sluggish touchscreen and 2) slightly flimsy buttons. This is nothing I can get worked up about.None of the downsides mentioned above can put a damper on my excitement. I'm very happy with this product. I'm still a tiny bit worried about the negative reviews and, subsequently, the longevity of this remote. Time will tell, and I'll adjust my rating if this thing fails within the first year or so. So far I'd highly recommend it. Great product!",1
"I looked at this remote 2 days ago and decided to try the Harmony 650 first to confirm that Logitech's infra red system would with our equipment and because it does I came back to purchase one of these too however, the price jumped by nearly 40.00.Lower the price and I am a customer of this remote too FWIW, the Harmony 650 works flawlessly.Thank you",1
This bluetooth portable speaker has very good sound quality and the battery life is outstanding it also works good as a handsfree for my phone.,1
I had the previous model (non WIFI) of the Slingbox and the Ethernet port stopped working. The M2 replacement is just awesome. Took me literally 2 minutes to install and it worked right out of the box. Only issue I have is with the Verizon box which does not allow 2 HDMI to connected do had to use component instead. Either way love the new product.,1
Good receiver at a good price. I like the built in bluetooth which you avoid getting tangled up with wires.,1
"This PNY Anarchy DDR4 memory kit gives your desktop a boost, operating at 2400MHz for fast multitasking and browsing.About cheaper than those famous big brand but still works good",1
Very easy to program. Controls all your gadgets. This is the best remote ever. You can personalize it with pictures and phrases. Easy to use anyone can use this.,1
The bass will make it keep moving so that it will eventually keep falling off whatever you set it on. Plus when it falls the side will pop off and eventually break so that they won't stay on making it so the water can get inside.,1
Nice,1
No issues whatsoever. Popped it in my PC and it's been working like a champ ever since.,1
"Awesome for outdoors, short battery life if left on full blast",1
"I came in to Best Buy to buy the Sony XB40 Bluetooth speaker but they were sold out. I was going to the lake for the weekend and wanted music in camp so I let the sales associate talk me into settling for the downsized XB30. I should have waited. The sound is not nearly as rich, and the bass is sub-standard. Whats worse, when I pushed the ""Mega Bass"" button in an effort to bump it up, I was rewarded with an annoying buzzing each time the bass hit. I subsequently returned the XB30 to Best Buy and upgraded to the XB40, which I have been very pleased with.",1
"This is the best speaker I have ever owned. The sound is so clear and the highs and lows are amazing. I was lenient on buying a Sony product after so many bad Sony products in mid 2000, but I'm glad I took a chance. I will now be buying more Sony audio products as well as a new TV as I'm replacing my home theater.",1
"I've been looking for high quality bluetooth headphones for over a year now. I walked into Bestbuy assuming I would buy the Bose Quietcomfort but walked out with the JBL 700 Elites. Great sound (and very adjustable using the JBL iOS app), wonderful build quality and very comfortable to wear. The fit is a bit snug, but I've got a large head.",1
This is my second Logitech Harmony. My first remote lasted well over 8 years and never had any issues except the battery would no longer maintain a charge. I was so satisfied with my first one that I decided to buy another. This remote will control almost anything u program in to it. It is very easy to set up and effortless to use. One buton turns on/off everything. The help feature fixes any issue with ease. My only complaint is that the battery life seems a bit short but I do use it quite a bit every day. I will forever continue to use Logitech for my remote needs.,1
Best Buys has the best prices anywhere. I check around but seem to always buy here,1
"These speakers deliver a rich, beautiful sound to our outdoor entertainment area.",1
"Feels great, works great... just all-around amazing!",1
Need a single solution to handle my entertainment center in my office. Longer to program than I thought it would take but overall once I learned the controls and programmed it the system became very easy to use.,1
Use every day. More comfortable over time. Best sound I've found.,1
These phones are outstanding. Hearing old songs and sounds I never noticed before. Great for watching movies on iPad.,1
"Tried the P3's, loved the sound quality but didn't like the feel on my ears after an hour or so. Decided to switch to an over the ear model and love the P7's. Vocals are crystal clear and the bass is rich without the overdone bass of many headphones. Very comfortable for long periods and with glasses on. They sound great with a tablet, phone, desktop or receiver and can play as loud as you would want without distortion with any of them. Expensive but worth it.",1
"I was looking for some quality Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones for my upcoming trip overseas. These are comfortable, fairly easy to set up, and have good rich sound. The app you download for your Bluetooth Source device gives you quite a bit of sound quality control. They fold up nicely and fit into a pouch which they provided.",1
shouls have bought a smart tv. Not as clear,1
For me it is a must to have to secure my online business transactions by using my own personal MIFI Jetpack.,1
"Great bracket. I first felt it was somewhat pricey, but after it was installed and the 65"" TV mounted, it was very secure, hence well worth the money.",1
"Beware that this mount will NOT fit the Sony XBR75x850c without some customization that you will have to learn on the fly. It is not in the instructions or on the Sanus website. I probably wouldn't have bought this mount for this TV if I knew of the problem ahead of time. I only came to the realizations discussed below after spending several hours trouble shooting the situation, by which time I had nicked the mount up a bit and felt I couldn't return it.The problem is that the two bracket bars that you mount on the TV sit flush so you assume you do not need to use any of the provided spacers. However, once you mount the TV onto the wall unit and try and put the click cap on the lower cross bar (part number 22), you'll see that this lower cross bar goes so far that it hits raised edges on either side of the back panel of the TV. This is slight, but prevents the lower bar from fully seating into the receivers of the vertical brackets. This prevents the click cap from fitting properly and you won't be able to screw it together. The click cap is a critical component because it holds the bottom of the TV into place on the mount, which is very important when you are tilting the TV.There are two possible solutions. One is to install a spacer between the bracket bar and TV when you start off. Two problems here, one is that it will now be 1/2 less flush, and the other is that there does not seem to be a medium length screw provided that will fit the small spacer yet not penetrate too far into the TV. There is a short screw, fine for when not using any spacer, and a long screw that looks too long to use with the small spacer with this Sony TV (which appears to have a shallow screw receiver. Sorry that I can't tell you if it is since I went directly to solution number two: cut a few inches off the end of each side of the lower horizontal bar to prevent it from running over into the raised area of the back of the TV. This appears fine to me because this lower bar just appears to provide stability. The top bar and wall unit hold the weight. Basically you are cutting the lower horizontal bar short of where the back of the TV sticks out again. Not elegant, I suppose, but it works and keeps it more flush to the wall. You'll see what I mean if you have to go through this exercise.I'm fine with other aspects of the mount. We mounted dead center on the wall so didn't have to worry about the tilt issues that other people mention, but I could see where that could be a problem since the mount has some play. You'd probably have to pay a lot more for a stiffer mount (!).The people at Sanus were very helpful dealing with other questions I had. And I have been happy with two other mounts I bought form them for other TVs. I tried to explain all the above to them but was unsuccessful because its hard to do unless you are looking at it together.",1
So far to date I haven't had any problems with these drives right out of the box. They've outlasted my hardware I installed them in and enjoyed the performance.,1
"Where are the buttons Hoping I could customize to get the TiVo skip buttons, no. No number keypad is annoying. Battery life annoying, no warning of impending death. Old harmony would warn of dying battery. Please someone make a decent remote again! Returning.",1
"WOW! WOW! WOW! We debated on getting this remote. We knew we did not want a voice activated one, and we also knew from experience that we did not want 3 - 5 remotes to operate our television, bluray, music, wii, and cable. After reading the reviews here and on other websites, we decided to go with the Harmony Ultimate One. Geek Squad programmed it along with our 4K Ultra HD tv installation. This is the best money we have ever spent! It is super easy and we only need one remote for everything!! EVERYTHING!",1
I bought these to increase the RAM on my Mac desktop. Easy to install and made that spinning ball a thing of the past.,1
Good quality. Sounds great. I came in a huge box. But it's a nice size for my living room.,1
Great remote! Love the charger. The support is great! My 2nd one and even my wife can program it!,1
i just bought this blue tooth Sony h.ear go speaker and it is awesome. sounds really great. loud and different settings..,1

l like the fact that you can use your earphones for using a regular phone and hear it well,1
"Just what I was looking for, practically brand new, thank you!!",1
"Someone complained about the noise and lives 6 miles away in a different neighborhood. Rich powerful sound and has visual stimulation with LEDs that will change colors at 200bpm precisely, I don't know how they make the lights go with the music but it is a really neat feature. Also sounds excellent with any music genre at any volume unless you're trying to have a party with more than like 200 people.",1
This mouse is hands down the best wireless one that I have ever used.,1
Needed a backpack bag to handle all my equipment and sup pies. This would up be a perfect selection.,1
Love it. Speed is very good. Price is fair and it does the job.,1
"A bit more complicated than the previous one, but works well.",1
solid product that was competitively prices. would recommend.,1
My husband love it it was a gift and perfect good product,1
had to return because of one defective stick. good looking memory though.,1
This is our 5th logitec remote and 2nd.Of this model. Love them. Easy to use and simple to update. Only complaint about this model is battery life. Does not last nearly as long as the others we have in the house,1
This TV has a beautiful color picture quality! The images for Netflix and other apps are visible too.,1
"So far so good! Took 2-3 people to install because it's heavy, but it's heavy for a reason (durability). Would recommend.",1
"Currently running on 32 GB of RAM by using this product on my PC and if anything to attach, is that I have no problems so far. Been running the PC for the past 2 months.",1
I love it it is the best it is slim and can fit in ur pocket easy,1
"Easy to set up, easy to use. Great enhancement for my theatre.",1
Works great with the surface pro 4,1

Pros: very clear soundhuge battery powervery good range for wifi and BT connectivity (perfect for backyard and garage work)water proof, pool proof, shock proof.Alexa assistant (need I say more?)Cons- as of now it supports only a limited music apps (no Spotify) - connecting to smart home devices is not so easy (had hard time connecting the megablast with my Phillips Hue home kits)- Bass on this device could be better for this price- the base that lets you dock the device while at home is an option at $40 and it comes in white color only.at the end I know for a fact that this device will last for years and survive a lot of parties/ camping, etc. the apps and Alexa support will hopefully get better with time.",1
Overall a great receiver! Had issues with the app but an email to alpine support will get you squared away.,1
"One of my front factory speakers blew on my '07 GMC. Price at dealer was $164 to replace the one speaker. For the same price, got both front speakers replaced and the sound is noticeable better, which is saying a lot because I have old ears!",1
It's perfect and I'm so glad I bought it for my husband. He loves it and doesn't want anyone to touch nor use his laptop. We love shopping at Vest Buy for all our electronic and gaming system.,1
"Ultimate One, a very good remote, pricey, but does everything you'd want in a remote and then some. Very easy to set up if you have all your product info. This remote does not include the hub, nor can you control Wii. It will let you input the Wii and turn on/off appropriate equipment but that's it. This one has a sleep timer which my old Harmony One didn't have. It's a nice feature. It's smaller than the Harmony One but feels good in hand. One issue is that without a number pad it's hard to use the remote without looking at it. It has a virtual keypad. The tactile keys are excellent and you can really feel when you press a key. All in all, it's very good, worked flawlessly the first time after set up. I may have wanted the hub so I could control everything from my IPAD, but it wasn't a deal breaker and you can always buy the hub separately. The set up program gives you an upgrade option if you buy the hub separately.",1
glad I decided to spend the extra for the computer way faster thanold one. Glad the sale person showed us what we wanted in a computer.,1
The picture is crystal clear and the inter-active web hub is smooth....,1
set up not easy need geek squad The geek squad was great,1
"bought for 13inch macbook pro 2010.easy install, power on with no problems.",1
Easy to set up and worked as it was supposed to. Truly plug and play,1
Love these speakers and the deal I got when combining them with an Alpine deck. Install was professional and easy. Would recommend.,1
"easy to install, very nice and slim. My only negative is that once it is installed the TV wobbles a little, but I would definetely recommended.",1
I wanted something I could wear while laying down on a couch or bed. If you lay your head on a pillow these are not very comfortable.,1
"Great remote, this is about my 6th generation of Logitech remotes and it is by far the best yet. Flexible programming and good back lighting. Reasons I did not give it 5 stars is the transport buttons are in a bit of an awkward place and the touch screen is twitchy when trying to input channel numbers directly, does not always pick up all presses, could just be my dry fingers after decades of working with my hands. Anyway, I cannot imagine having a home theater setup that does not include one of these remotes.",1
I enjoy listening to talk radio. Sirius is perfect!,1
This product is top of the line. I travel frequently and use a desktop computer. With this wireless adapter I can pickup motel internet with ease. How many times have you gone to a motel that says they have high speed only to be drowned out by the other residents. The only reason I don't 5 start this product is price. It's not extremely high just up there. I have no complaints.,1
"I love this speaker. I was in the market for a decent wireless bluetooth speaker, and I usually go with Sony products. I bought this on sale (about $30 off regular price) only because the box boasted Hi-Res Audio and Extra Bass. The sound quality coming out of this speaker is excellent. I could not ask for anything better. I am currently considering purchasing another to pair the two. The only faults of this speaker are the price and supported apps. Very confusing out of the box, but I guess the Song Pal app makes it easier to pair to it than just doing it without. BUY on sale.",1
"UPDATE ... Bottom Line Up Front: DON'T BUY SONY MARINE PRODUCTS. Corrosion formed over two weeks on a brand new unit ... enough corrosion to void the manufactures warranty. I can only assume that the advertising on the anti-corrosion coating is EXTREMELY exaggerated or that this is a manufacturing defect (my contention with them). After this experience, I will not even CONSIDER a Sony marine ANYTHING. It is NOT manufactured correctly to handle use on water.This radio was a disappointment for a very specific reason: It failed within a month of first usage. Even worse, the warranty REPLACEMENT unit failed less than a month after installing it. The first unit's failure was the inability to leave demo mode, i.e. making it useless. The second unit's failure was more spectacular ... a blown fuse on the water leaving a nice toxic smoke behind the control panel. This was followed by the blowing of a replacement fuse back on shore when power was reapplied. Obviously, something in the unit has a major short -- the second fuse blew immediately, produced some arcing, and a nice puff of toxic smoke!Kudos to Sony on the first replacement process. No so good on this second replacement. At least it's under warranty (and I bought an Amazon extended warranty, too).When it worked, the sound was good with plenty of volume without distortion. Bluetooth with an iPhone worked fine but it was slightly cumbersome getting them paired. It was easy to read in the bright sunlight and fairly easy to operate. Tuning FM could be a challenge but once I got it going, it wasn't that difficult.If I were to do this over, I would NOT buy this radio. Instead, I would spend the additional money on a Sonichub 2 to work with my Lowrance unit and put a plate over the hole in my boat's dash.",1
All in all for the price these are some nice speakers. They aren't heavy on the bass department but vocals mids and highs sound great,1
This is a great product and easy to setup. Really enjoy watching games anywhere.,1
"I bought this obviously to watch my pets. One of them has been digging at some trim and I wanted to see who it was. I have witnessed the culprit and am able to talk with her to get her to stop. I have been using for 2 weeks now, almost daily. When I go to work is my main concern, but have tried even while out shopping, dining etc. The picture has always been crystal clear, however, it does switch between black and white and color. Not sure why but it's not a major issue for me. You can can hear them or mute them, speak with them, check on the room temperature, it has night vision that works in the complete darkness and still get a nice picture. They also will save the recordings for you for a small fee. They give 7 days free. My only dissatisfaction with this product is that you cannot raise the volume on the camera itself and I feel it's a little on the low side. I do know the dogs can hear me when I speak to them. There are 2 holes in the bottom to mount, but the way I would really like to mount it turns the camera upside down and the picture stays that way, it won't right itself. I'm satisfied with this little camera and has done what I need it to do. When I have to be away from the pups I can still check in on them and talk with them. It has actually put me at ease and given me a little peace of mind. I can see that they are doing well, have water, they are playing and most importantly that they are safe and peaceful. My boss made a good point today as well. The direction the camera faces happens to be my front door, so I can see if anyone breaks in or if there should be a fire or some dangerous situation, I will know in real time.",1
"I purchased this stand and used it for a 55 Samsung LED Smart TV. The stand works well and the assembly was fairly easy. It is a pretty solid assembly with the 55 TV. I have no concerns about it tipping but I would strap it to the wall if there were children in the home. The price point is great. The kit included several different bolts and washers to attach the mount to nearly any type of TV. I would give it 5 stars however, I had to use different bolts and washers with the mount. The TV wobbled and shook with the bolts that were included with the kit. I recommend that if you are moving from a wall mount to table top that you use your old wall mount bolts.",1
"The fingerprint reader works well for the times the camera does not recognize you, always connects unlike Bluetooth, magnetic catches work for quick easy secure attachment.",1
"Wow I am really disappointed in this product. I have owned a Harmony One for about 5 years and it has been really great. It is wearing out and so I decided to replace it with this newer remote. the controls do not seem to be as intuitive to me. It is missing a few key features, the biggest of which is the ability to skip ahead with my DVR. I can fast forward, but not skip ahead What were they thinking I also really dislike the swipe to unlock that you are constantly having to swipe to get to the controls on the screen. I have actually gone back to using my aging Harmony One and this item is now really a decoration. Bummer",1
It doesn't seem to know all the commands/functions my devices are capable of.,1
"The bad: It's a two handed remote. By that I mean that you have to hold it in your hand to use it. You can't just leave it on the end table or other surface and reach over and push a button on it because the bottom is rounded. Another design flub is that the transport keys are located above the touch screen ! If you want to push play, rewind, pause etc., and you brush your hand across the touch screen before it times out you'll change the channel, or something else. Very irritating!! The good: It's very easy to program, and the charging cradle it a winner !",1
"It holds our 65"" samsung without issue ore movement. They installed it hitting all beams, my worries will be if I ever move will I be able to remove it myself. Well done Geeksquad.",1
"For such a small system,this thing packs a nice punch. Nice design,I'm happy overall. Cons- speaker wires in box interfere with bass so it's not as clean as it could be when cranked.Power cord is short.Stick her anywhere and feel the bass!,preferably a corner......Highly recommend.",1
"My problem was that the laptop was no longer charging. Purchased this Lenovo adapter and it worked at first. Now, nine months later, it is doing the same thing it did before.",1
did exactly what I was looking for - allowed me to watch TV remotey,1
"Easy to setup, work great. Rate AAA+",1
"This wall mount does not allow the television to pivot out to more than 30 degrees which means it only slightly pivot from left to right,sorry guys thumbs down on that",1
I love how it snaps into place. Easy to use. Only needs a light touch.,1
"These are perfect for upgrading older iMac Minis. Just pop the top, remove the old RAM and plug these in. They won't necessarily transform your machine into a powerhouse like a SSD will, but they can help with preventing memory paging, which is another performance killer.",1
Portable and powerful. Charges quickly and battery lasts for a long time.,1
"Had crucial 16gb and it sucks, bought PNY no problem , run like a charm",1
"This Sony stereo was better than i expected, i was surprised how loud it was, with a crisp clear sound! I'm ready to throw a party now lol",1
"great, but the touch screen is not very sensitive and u have to slap it and try to get it to go to other screens over and over again. But it is very reliable.",1
Love the new finger scan. Great feel and ease of use.,1
"I've only had this a few weeks, but ... Feels solid, good tactile feel for my typing needs, good key layout. Backlight works great, although it doesn't turn off automatically when not needed (i.e. in a well lit room). Fingerprint sensor seems to work as advertised. Touchpad works nicely. Somewhat pricey, but it works great. Wish it came in colors other than black.",1
Bought it for the wife so things turn on and off correctly . . .,1
No I can watch allMy sports channels on the go and at my computer at work!,1
Sound quality is good very stylish only complaint is not as loud as I would like them to be,1
Great deck but some things can be tweaked third-party application icons such as Google music don't show up and it's kind of annoying also there are no different background displays,1
"I've owned more than a dozen Bluetooth headphones over the last 2-3 years, most end up returned or quickly retired to a shelf. The Everest Elite 700 will not suffer either of these fates, it is exactly what I have been looking for.Bluetooth, adjustable noise canceling, great sound and comfortable fit, it's all there. I use mine with my home theater, a Bluetooth transmitter attached to the headphone output of the AV receiver, and headphones paired with that. Music, 4k movies, sports, all are represented well by the sound of these headphones. Good but not overpowering bass and no perceptible loss of mid and high tones. I highly recommend them.",1
"The Harmony Ultimate One is a great universal remote. It will eliminate the need for all the remotes you currently have, even for products that are 20 years old. The programing isn't too complex, but it will take some getting use to. Some TVs that you use for local, over-the-air (don't use cable or satellite), won't be able to work with the touch screen Favorites, due to the subchannel system. The remote touchscreen is great feature. With less buttons to wear out, it should last for years. The buttons it does have are backlit, so it is good to use in the dark. It is also rechargeable (comes with a base for recharging). So it will save on batteries.",1
The memory works great in my iMac! No problems with installation. Very good instructions.,1
Received on time and as advertised. Prefer bottoms to touch screen. You can easily hit the wrong command on the touch screen if you are no looking directly at it.,1
"it looks good with style. Audio quality is so so to me, maybe I had high expectation.",1
I brought this Bluetooth speaker for my son's birthday gift. He loved it!,1
I love it is hands down the best remote control that I ever owned,1
Got it on sale and i am very pleased with it so far.,1
"Previous Verizon Hotspot was stolen. Pretty quick purchase. Even with a external antenna, does not seem to have the reception ability previous one had",1
I love the speaker that I purchased. I thank God for the staff that helps me and made my purchased very pleasant,1
For a small speaker they have great sound and hooking them up is so easy if you have little room for placement they are great for that . Being Bose I wouldn't expect anything less,1
Makes life much easier without having to deal with 10 remotes laying around,1
These fit in my Sony handycam and work great nice picture and just the right length,1
works great,1
This remote is the best one I've ever owned. All the controls for my system are in the palm of my hand and no more having to go to reciever to change the volume and then go to DVR to change channels.,1
I just ordered this tv and unless I am doing something wrong I cannot access the smarthub inthe same manner that I see other people using it on videos . I am under the impression that the 5 Series tv I ordered (UN32M5300AFXZA) has an older version of Smarthub and although I did a factory reset of the tv my issue was not resolved. I see people accessing their Smarthub simply by pressing a button on their remote but my remote doesn't have a Smarthub buttom and I've downloaded an app that has it but I cannot access it . Clearly this is not the Samsung tv that comes with Google Play that would make this so much better and user friendly. I have tried everything to attempt to download an app or game but it seems as though that must've been on an older model tv . Nice tv nonetheless and the picture is amazing just can't figure out how to update the firmware or download apps from Google Play if this is even possible,1
Yamaha speakers provide balanced sound. Really happy with the sound quality for the price.,1
Loving my new keyboard for surface pro 4. The keys light up and the fingerprint scanner works great!,1
"I have purchased 7 of these between two Lenovo Ts440 Servers, one is for a replacement. So far they have all been performing just fine. I have had no issues and I would recommend these drives, Western Digital does have a new version out now.",1
"I have synced this with my Echo Dot to provide a richer sound, both for the standard voice as well as music playing . These speakers work very well in that service.",1
"If you are looking for a set of speakers to upgrade home theater system, buy this one",1
"While changing channels could be slightly smoother, this is a great solution for watching tv on the go, or saving you the money of renting a 2nd or 3rd cable box.",1
added the remote to my total system and simple to use. Love it. Best ever,1
"I bought these headphones on Black Friday for a really cheap price. These headphones exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is amazing on these headphones. I use an Ipod Touch to sync it wirelessly and it syncs w/out any problems. I use it to listen to music while I work out and I dont have to worry about the wires getting caught while I'm lifting weights. I just put my Ipod in my pocket and press shuffle and go.The bass is good, but not overwhelming. I guess it depends on the quality of the sound file that you're listening to. Overall, these headphones are excellent and a keeper.",1
"I own 2 of these. turns out that these can be added on to the SONY soundbars and work as rear surround speakers. The sound quality is amazing. They are really well built and feel really solid. I do have one complaint about the song pal app, its not as good as some of the other ""networked audio"" apps out there. I hope it will get better with time.",1
Very easy to use and love the way you don't have to charge it to use it...,1
this was very easy to hook up to my computer. I am very happy with the purchase,1
"Always loved Netgears hardware, and this is no different. Hooked up to my router easily and runs super fast.",1
This new keyboard is just about perfect.I really like the fingerprint reader as a back up.,1
Great replacement for VW Jetta rear door speakers.,1
Great speakers. I was just WoW when turned on after a simple install. Sound quality is natural and clear. This is not for a Boom system.... this is quality not quantity. Good luck.,1
I ordered 2 of them to build a computer and one worked flawlessly while the other failed.,1
"This is the third Logitech remote I have purchased this year. I have had nothing but trouble with it. I try to turn the volume on and it goes on mute. When I try to turn it up,it goes on it's blaring . I have two other remotes and they take AA batteries. This one you have to charge up every other day). The Logitech I have in the bedroom has lasted 7 years. And I only charge that one only once a week. I have a 2 year extended warranty on it...but the last one I had a 2 yr warranty on it and the Geek Squad hassled me about reinstalling it for free.",1
this purchase helped to increase the memory room on my Mac. now runs quicker. and it was easy to install!,1
"Very loud. Sounds is clear and send to have good battery life. Lights are pretty cool too, but if you're using it outside pretty useless.",1
"Verizon's 4G Mi-Fi was easy to install and get online. If you have the need for a mobile internet or just an alternative to the high priced internet for your home, this is the way to go.",1
"Needed to replace a Harmony 650 that I'd wore out the buttons on from use. After upgrading to a new TV, decided to upgrade to a more advanced remote, and Harmony was best option. Was able to get this remote for a little over 100 and so far its proven well worth it. Imported my 650 config into my new remote and in 5 minutes it was working great. Only tweeked a few settings so far and easy via newer software interface. Overall ver pleased with this remotes performance.",1
"This control does not work well even after multiple upgrades to the software; you can click on a channel and not get the one programmed but another one - usually with 2 or 3 digits for a 4 digit channel - e.g. 1004 comes in 04, 104, 14, and eventually it will go to 1004. I do not recommend this to anyone.",1
Great product. Easy to use. No problems. Would certainly recommend,1
Great product. Set up was intuitive and logical. Makes combining several controllers a breeze.,1
Took a little getting used to but works great. I was familiar with the online setup from my other Harmony remote. I was up and running in about 15 minutes.,1
it does what it is designed to do very well for !!!,1
Bought this to replace one which had been hit by lightning! Loved the last one and love this one as well! Better picture quality than an older Sony! Picture is so clear you can see the details!,1
"solid, this is my 5th one, i don't use any thing else. bought 2 open box before, excellent condition, save money that way.",1
Amazing feat of technology. I think these are the same tapes used by the Apollo missions. I can't figure out how the moving pictures are stamped on the tape (perhaps witchcraft) but the oohs and ahhs are always well worth the increased price. They have allowed me to document my howling wolf shirt in many different social situations.,1
This Harmony replaced my 7 year old Harmony 840. It was super easy to setup and when I replaced my amp was even easier to reprogram it.,1
Easy to install and works like a charm! when the TV is not in use the TV can be pushed fairly flush to the wall.,1
Highs and mids are good but bass sucks,1
Working fantastically.,1
"We purchased a pair of Beats for my daughter and she loved them, but they broke. She sent the broke pair in for a new pair, and they worked for a while, then the sound went out. So, we deciced to purchase a different brand. JBL is the working well with little to no issues.",1
"Great television, good sound, good graphics and great resolution.",1
My son loves the ability to simply sign into his new surface with a fingerprint.,1
Product works well but I think I would but the wireless next time for ease of updating.,1
I own a beat headset and Boss each have sound good but the JBL it's in a different class,1
i have 4 aw5500 on my outdoor patio I replaced my sony center channel with aw6500 wow so I have 4 aw5500 1 aw6500 for a center channel pairs up real nice and has nice base sound. big sound at low level I am also running a 10 inch sony sub nice clean sound happy happy,1
"Installation was easy and with the addition of a mic for calls is a plus, getting the radio setup was quick and easy, 5 star",1
Programming it is easy. It does take some tweaking and fiddling with it to get it to work just the way you want it. Overall a great remote!,1
"Great remote, controls multiple devices, activity based, and easy to program",1
These speakers are very easy to install and took less than an hour. The sound is incredible. They are a good value for the price.,1
Was using the Harmony app with my mobile devices and decided to try the remote. Works great!,1
"Love this remote. It's easy to use and have not had any problems at all. Love the ""help"" feature where it finds the problem with my equipment and corrects it.",1
"My Sling is connected to Verizon Fios box. I used the RCA connection to connect from the FIOS box to SLING and then another RCA connection to connect to a TV. FIOS does not allow using HDMI for two outputs. The picture is stable, sound is great.. The remote is on the screen and easily learnt. It was easy setup and I am very happy with my purchase.",1
"I bought this camera after my dog had been hospitalized with seizures, severe anemia and hypothyroid. Dr.'s orders required I monitor him at all time as he was very weak and tired. I was able to leave the house to run errands, get groceries etc while I watched every move he made. I can hear every breath, see every move, talk to him, play five different melodies, take video and still pics. It's simple to set up and operate. Extremely reliable as it is motion activated or you can just watch it live all of the time.",1
Got a great deal on the mouse. The shape is perfect for my hands.,1
Great sound system Would definitely recommend...,1
These are nice and clear fit in nicely easy to install,1
Very useful as it is light and comfortable to use. Instead of typing on the screen make the experience more enjoyable and productive. The fingerprint is handy and helps avoid having to type the password everytime.,1
"I've been using Harmony Remote for years. The Ultimate One is my latest upgrade as my 888 died. I am now using 3 of these.This series is by far the easiest to program and update. The online software talks you through setup, you just have to know your equipment and what inputs you're using. Setup should take no more then 20-30 minutes.",1
Speakers arrived I pulled my door panels off pulled the factory speakers out the I opened the new box of alpines pulled a speaker out and found speaker severely damaged with a split cone. Poor QI from wherever amazon got speakers from.,1
"love this remote, i could finally set aside the 5 i have to just use this one.",1
"Had to return. Heavy,tight and if you touched the area around the Mic, it made the speaker sound like it was cracked. Very annoying. I did like the sound of the speaker, when listening.",1
"These headphones sound amazing and the noise cancelling is second only to bose, I'd wager. The bass isn't that strong, but most can live without it. My only gripe with these is that they are modern on your ears. Not painful, so to speak, but the pressure of the ear cups is definitely uncomfortable after about 15 minutes.",1
The process it took to add my fingerprint and have it be accurate was very short and easily done.,1
"I was looking for a pair of ceiling speakers for our new kitchen addition to be used with a SONOS system. The powered SONOS cube has 55 watts / per channel and it is more than enough power to make these speakers sound good.I was afraid that if I only went with a 5 1/4 or 6 1/2 inch woofer, I'd be disappointed with the fullness and bass output. So I knew I had to buy a pair of 8 inch woofers to satisfy my high standard for sound quality. I was also slightly afraid that for under $200, these speakers wouldn't sound as good as some higher priced models.I am happy to report that these speakers ROCK!! They have good full sound and good bass output (for 8 inch speakers). They sound awesome and I have no complaints at all. The sound they produce is equal to, if not better, than many more expensive models.",1
Excellent sound until I listened to the spoken word. My left side had a rattle when certain pitches were obtained.,1
"These are the best pair of headphones I've ever had. Granted, I know there are much better headphones out there, but at this price, this is the best I've heard. Comfy fit, and the bells and whistles are cool! Auto-calibration and Ambient Aware are awesome features! Highly recommend!",1
The keyboard and touch pad are big upgrade over Pro 3 one. The fingerprint reader works wonderfully with Windows 10 Hello login. Takes less than a second to wake up and recognize. Highly recommend. Don't get it for SP4 since that has Hello capable camera.,1
"comfortable, but noise cancelation is not as good.",1
easy to set up easy to use.nice to only need one remote,1
Very happy with our purchase. Great price and easy to use,1
I have had many gopro carrying items but this one is definitely my favorite. Makes everything convient and it protects against theft.,1
"Took away one star due to lag. Every time you press a button on the virtual remote, there is noticeable and significant delay, and the stream actual freezes, not sure why. Video streams great, but controls are kind of clunky. I use the IR cable, due to device location, not sure if that introduces the lag. Other than waiting for the device to respond after remote commands, it works great.",1
Works well and holds a charge. I use it at work most days.,1
The picture is good but sound could be better.,1
"Has worked PERFECTLY since installation. Now the A6100 NETGEAR, a totally different story. But, this is about another model, and a suggested buy. NOT disappointed at all.",1
Get CH#130? IF No THEY are selling you an outdated platform,1
"This remote was a replacement for a Harmony 550. It blows the 550 away. Ergonomically, a much better design. I like the ease of use. It runs through the commands much faster, so it turns on and off the devices much quicker. I run a TV, Blu-Ray system, VCR (yes, I still have one), plus the cable box off of it. I use the Blu-Ray system to run the audio for a Wii (yes, we have one of those, too!). The remote has a charger/base, so I don't have to worry about batteries. The touch screen is very nice and responsive. It can be adjusted for background and lock time. It's a breeze to program from the computer, and can even be adjusted from the remote. I would highly recommend it.",1
"I got this system to replace my old (very old) Panasonic AV receiver. I ordered it because the product description said the EQ function says there is a setting that allows one to create their own custom EQ setting. Knowing that most preset EQ settings do VERY little in terms of equalization, I thought this was the way to go if I wanted a good bass setting since there is no bass or crossover controls for the sub-woofer.When I received the system, I discovered that not only was there no customizable EQ setting but the bass was very weak. I boxed it up and sent it back. For the price, it's junk!",1
All i know is if the sales rep was honest about the data use we would never purchased it. Either way our last time we will buy from you again. Nothing was done now stuck paying cancellation fee.,1
The technology freezes and loops. It also fails toporperly set or turn off single devices in sets. This causes you to have to do troubleshooting and a manual fix.,1
"When I got this it had a attached cover letter to help you get started. Didn't work for me. First, I could not find the Android App in the Play Store. There were other similar Apps but none of them looked like they were applicable. And their reviews were not very good. So I went to my Apple iPad and found a App there. During the setup the speaker itself needed to be set up on my WiFi. I did that and then it failed several times to connect to a update server. I have a limited WiFi connection and this chewed up about 300 Megs and still not a peep out of the speaker. I think this device is way too complicated for the average user.",1
"You can't argue with the price. Once I found the right screwdriver this took me less than 10 minutes from start to finish. Works great in a Mid-2009 MBP 13"".",1
I recently increased the capacity of our RAID 5 NAS system and installed the WD Red drives. They are much faster than the old drives and have worked flawlessly since the upgrade. It's helpful to have the choice of a drive designed for this purpose in the WD Red product line.,1
I have one come with my computer is not so good that one is good,1
Love the LED and g logo. Very easy to move and click.,1
Very easy to set-up/program. This is the third Harmony I have added to our collection and would add another if needed.,1
This universal remote is great. It is easy to program and use. With the touch of one button you can turn on and operate all devices needed to watch TV or many other activities.,1
"Had to return, although we were told that this box would connect to our current cable system it did not.",1
"The M2 Slingbox is a great way to watch tv while traveling. Hotels often have a very limited number of channels, but with the Slingbox you can access your home television and movies on the Direct TV DVR so long as you have a good wifi signal and a laptop or IPad..",1
"My Netgear Nighthawk AC3200 Router sits on the main floor at one end of my house. My office is in the basement at the other end of the house. I have an older laptop that could only do 2.4GHz, 802.11g protocol. I bought this companion Netgear USB adapter. I went from 18Mbps to 88Mbps and I'm sure it can do more, that's just the limit of my current ISP. This is a rock solid network adapter. If you have a router that does 802.11n or ac with a 5GHz radio, then this is a excellent upgrade for an older laptop/desktop. I'll be switching to 1 gigabit fiber optic soon. Can't wait to see what speed I get.",1
My son had a mid 2010 macpro laptop and was complaining about being sluggish. Quick look at Apple support showed how to upgrade Ram from existing 2gb to 4gb..took literally 5 min after finding the ram modules at Best Buy... he can actually run a couple of applications at the same time now. This should hold him until he can actually spring for a iMac desk top with 16gb ram.,1
Great value for it's cost. Great sound and easy to bring anywhere,1
keyboard works fine.fingerprint recognition works well.,1
Great product we love this product and it works perfectly,1
This product is ok. It has a tendency to repeatttt.,1
The best sounding speakers ever used on a job. Beats cheapies by a mile - better sound than Bowers which are more expensive.,1
GOOD MATERIAL AND WELL MADE CAMERA BAG. I USE IT MOST OF THE TIME WHEN I SHOOT OUTDOOR. THIS BAG DELIVERS. ERGONOMICAL AND FASHIONABLE.,1
"They shipped quickly, goods packaging is also very fine, This works so much better than I thought it would. You can't do better for the price.if you want an economical and cost items will never miss it. arrived before expected, love them everyone needs these best buy for the dollar Its price is pretty reasonable among the store I have viewed. Great quality and delivered on time.",1
This speaker works great with my Iphone. The sound is great and has lots of bass.,1
"Sounds great in my truck . I have a 1990 f150, I put them in my door panels and to be the only speakers in my truck they sounds great",1
"Our last remove was also a Harmony. The only way to go. Our other one had the bottom worn off. It was time, even though it's pricy, worth every penny!",1
Good sound ... for the price ... was easy replacing the original speakers for the with the new ones,1
Great portable speaker. Not only the sound but the appearance itself,1
I think the fingerprint reader is probably not necessary for the Surface as facial recognition with the IR camera seems much quicker. The keyboard is responsive and compliments the Surface build and design perfectly. The touchpad is okay and that's why it loses a star for me. Make the touchpad a little more clickable.,1
Works great replaced an older version that I have had 6 years,1
This new fingerprint lock keyboard is one of the main selling points or the surface pro four for me.,1
These are just remarkable headphones.They're not inexpensive obviously but I guarantee you'll feel like you got your money's worth.I highly suggest you listen to music from a true hi-fi source such as Tidal online to appreciate just how great these are.,1
Harmony ruined these remotes! Taking the keypads away for a useless pathetic touch screen sucks.very sluggish GUI! Just horrible.,1
Available in store at a good price. It is getting harder and harder to find these. Best Buy came thru,1
"First, I have a commercial radio license and before I retired I was the Data Specialist for ATT, I previously had an 880 but after eight years it just wore out. As to the plus side of this remote, it is extremely versatile. You can leave the other remotes that came with your equipment in the drawer. Now the significant downside. You need to have an eyeball in you index finger. Replacing buttons with a press on the small screen is ludicrous and frustrating. Downer 2, the thing locks up for no reason what so ever. You have to cover the IR port and press the off button and then with the IR port still covered, you press the menu button then select on the screen what you were previously doing. If you want assistance, good luck on that, I hope you understand Philippine English better than I do. Frankly it's a huge loser. I've had it for three months and I'm going to put it on eBay and sell the useless thing.",1
This remote is easy to set up and makes one remote do the work of several.,1
The headphones offer exceptional clear and accurate sound. The over the ear design isolates your listening environment. Very comfortable for long periods of use.,1
"I had a prior version of this remote which was showing its age, so I decided to buy this new version. It is smaller and charges in an upright stand. It takes up less space, which is a benefit. The remote is a little awkward to handle at first, but I've gotten used to it for most features. The one item I wish were different was easier access to a numeric keypad to go to a channel on my satellite receiver box. The numeric keypad is there, just takes a couple clicks to get it showing.",1
"I compared this to all of the display units in two separate Best Buy stores just for a sanity check. There is no question for the money it sounds better than the other major speaker makers by far. You wouldn't necessarily think this about Sony speakers (I can vouch for that) but I am telling you this speaker is perfect if you are looking for something portable that you can listen to LOUD or soft and still sound very very good. It's got a little weight to it, but that just makes it feel solidly made. Sony takes a lot of moonshots and this is one that I think is very worthy.",1
Love the sound quality. For the price you can not go wrong with Sony.,1
Work very well and my phone got charged fully to 100%,1
Limited by length of wiring but sounds good,1
I had first bought a bigger sized Tv for my dorm and it was way too big so I returned it and purchased this one. Its the perfect size and it has great quality!,1
JBL always puts out that clear crisp sound every time. They can be loud or normal sound and have the same quality either way. Most speakers lose that quality the louder you go. Love all things JBL! Keep it up!,1
No xmp needed defaults at 2400 and looks good on my rampage v edition 10!!!,1
Great sound quality even at high volume and without separate amp.,1
"It was more difficult getting the various models of TV, receiver, etc. than entering the information. Looking forward to long term usage.",1
Not much you can say about ram. I built a new computer and my system posted without any trouble. I went with two of these kits for a total of 32gb ram and its performing exactly as I need and expect it to. Cannot go wrong with PNY.,1
"First time customer of PNY, really disappointed with the quality of this, although this is the only 2 sticks of RAM I've gotten from them thus far. RAM came in faulty, and I only realised it after a few days of using it, with constant crashes, and computer freezing randomly when using this RAM. Hopefully customer service can help me out and offer a refund, because I need a working computer, and can't wait for 3 weeks for the RMA.Review will be updated if problem is corrected.",1
"Great TV, good picture, etc. BUT A WORD OF WARNING, and it may not be a big deal for everyone, however, In trying to connect the TV to my network and entering password, the 'smart' tv is telling me the wifi password is incorrect. I know the password, confirmed it many times. After calling customer service, they asked if my password had any unique characters (it does) and they told me the TV will not allow for special characters in a password to be able to connect. This is a huge inconvenience (going to have to change every device in my house for this TV), not too mention a matter of security (the more random numbers and characters the better). I am shocked that Samsung knows this and won't make any kind of change. I almost want to return the TV just based on that fact and the fact that security should be paramount to any company that deals with internet and privacy.",1
I think this speaker is great it has awesome sound I would recommend it,1
I love not having all the boxes remotes. But having to charge it really often. Is a pain. And the shape of it and the way it sits is odd.,1
This Sony wireless speaker is one of the best that I've heard and all my friends are amazed at the sound that they put out the flashing lights are ok to,1
So happy with this product would buy again totally,1
Better than expected. Highly recommend this computer!!!,1
Definitely get the Geek Squad to set this up!! Well worth the $99. for set up. Now we can flip between audio and video devices with a push of one button. Very easy to use,1
"Mounted this in my overhead T Top box, make sure you install a quality antenna, stong sound, easy mounting, and so far no issues!!",1
the battery life is good. always connects when turned on,1
"WE were tired of having 5 romotes laying around. Our Best Buy Guy suggested this Harmony remote. Geek squad set it up for us when they delivered our tv and blu-ray. I'm a Mac person, so it seemed pretty user friendly to me with it's menus. My husband is not really a Mac person, so it took just a little bit, but I think he finds it's user friendly. Have to put it in the stand to recharge when it gets low...not used to that.",1
We really enjoy the Kingbox. We're able to watch our Directv shows from a remote location,1
This is by far the best mini surge protector/charger I've owned. Charging my devices on the go is really easy and the backup battery is ideal for taking boosting my mobile devices far away from an outlet.,1
The Sony speakers work a lot better than I expected.,1
works as advertised. no complaints. would recommend,1
"Sound is good and radio stations stay locked, real good radio",1
absolutely outstanding picture.,1
Your own movies and live tv if you travel a lot. It would be nice for it to have different tv turner.,1
These remotes are just not reliable. I've had 4 over the past 4 years and all but my newest one have gone bad within a couple years. These are too expensive to be replacing so often and they only come with a one year warranty. They also only come with a limited amount of free phone service support from logitech which seems like an aniquated business model to me. My latest remote is under two years and just broke last night as I was updating a component. Even the complete factory reset doesn't unlock the frozen remote!!,1
"I bought this speaker with great expectations. I heard a lot about of Hi-res audio lately and I really wanted to see and hear what was it.Boy, was I happy listening? You bet, I was. This something new that we are going to hear a lot about. This will be the new standard of audio.",1
"Alpine is known to make good car stereos and this one is good if you use an iPhone only. Without an iPhone tethered, it's just a radio with a 7 inch display. With your iPhone it transfers the UI of the phone to the unit, but does not play video. You get your calls, texts, maps, and music apps only since playing video is illegal when driving. If your an iPhone user, I would highly recommend it!",1
"I am looking for a 32 TV for my 95 year old Mother. She prefers one with a sleep timer. I have not found one available. I am disheartened to see the review for the 32 Samsung that indicates smart function problems. I would like to buy a Samsung, as I currently have 3-Models that work well. I would like to know that they have repaired the Smart TV problem before committing to their 2017 32 model. Is there any way to find out or be alerted that the the problem has been fixed I have the 2015 32 model with Apple TV, Roku outboard devices. It too does not function as advertised by the manufacturer. But the picture is exceptional. It seems that Samsung has not put their technology to bare on this problem, though they continue to promote the feature. Also, I was surprised to find the latest Samsung TV that I purchased was manufactured in Mexico. It dos not seem to be of the same quality as the previous models that I have purchased. Has anyone found that it is also the case for them",1
I purchase this remote as a upgrade to Logitech Harmony 650 because of the need to change battery. Remote was very easy setting up utilizing downloaded software. The touch screen is very responsive in changing channels The help button works great If the remote fail to run its activity correctly. The menu system take a bit getting use to but once learn you will really see the outstanding function of this remote. Highly recommend purchasing this remote,1
"Product was a gift for my daughter-in-law who has a new camera and wanted a way to carry her camera and accessories while hiking, etc. She liked the many compartments and that the zipper to access them was toward the back and not exposed to anyone behind her.",1
"This computer is the best conputer i have had yet. Connecting bluetooth keyboard, mouse, speakers and printer was a piece of cake, it even comnected to daughters headphones in the other room with a push of the button. Top of the line all the way",1
"Great mice, at first it felt to big, but the reason is being I had a smaller and flatter mouse before, this one fits nice and comfortable on hand, has inactivity auto off and auto on after movement. Very good quality knowing I accidently dropped it from 5 ft to the floor it did not even leave a scratch and still worked well, I was in shock.",1
Easy to use with good features New model has easy to see controls and features. works well with indoor dock and in the car,1
These speakers sound great. No downsides. The bass has plenty of loudness. Range of sound is beautiful.,1
Great purchases and a great prices for great sound,1
Great unit so far. For most bay boat set-ups running your speakers off the built in amp out to 4 coaxials and a separate mono amp for a sub in the console should be all you need to thump hard. Unless you want to go uber crazy then use all external amps. Love the wireless remote.,1
"Great Sound quality, good size and great value. Definitely would recomment",1
Installed this in my MacBook Pro with ease! Works great!!,1
The charger is really good. It appears to power up my electronics faster than my normal outlets. The only downside is that it was bigger than I thought it was.,1
"I bought these for my grandson as I have bought many other brands that failed. This by far, has been the most reliable and quality.",1
Great! These are the tapes my camera takes and they work great every time!,1
these speakes sound awsome compared to the stock ones. big world of difference and the price was great also. the installation guys were very informative and do supperb work also. i will definetly get all my car audio needs from the pro's at best buy and the geek squad crew.thanks for the great job fellas!!!,1
Love the whole system! The installation was explained and he was very good at what he does,1
Great TV and great price. Purchased for bedroom...,1
The keyboard has a great feel with it's elevated keys. The only drawback so far is that the fingerprint reader tends not to work whenever I wake the computer from sleep or standby.,1
Love the ability to have it immediately illuminate when picked up or moved so you can see the screen without touching any buttons. Fairly intuitive to setup and a great way to combine your devices into one remote.,1
I was able to utilze the sling box app on my phone and hook it up to an HDMI cord available in our caravan. I had to purchase an adapter from the Apple Store (connecting iPhone to HDMI outlet). The kids no longer have to watch the same DVDs on road trips. This product works great.,1
Needed two sets of bluetooth headphones so we can use both for watching TV at the same time. Great reception...great price!!,1
"After dreaming about an outdoor system for a while, and after reading all the reviews on many of the outdoor speakers in my price range, I popped for these. Not disappointed, great full rich sound. I live in a rural area and am able to easily fill the entire area with crisp clear music. Of course I don't have any neighbors to annoy. Powered with a Yamaha receiver, and run through an apple express I can control everything through my IPhone. Great set up for working out in the yard or grilling. Mounted them on a garden shed under an awning for a little protection of my investment. You won't be disappointed!",1
This was a perfect accessory to the Surface. I would recommend it.,1
"Excellent quality, packaging and price for this higher end DIMM set.",1
"Being able to test these speakers in the store really made this decision easy. I wanted something mainly for the garage and mainly for talk radio/podcast listening. With the bass boost turned off, this sounds great, if maybe still a little too bassy, and music sounds amazing without it too. The big name, heavy bass brand of wireless speaker still has way too much bass even with the boost turned off. The other options available from Sony ( WiFi, and the phone feature) sealed the deal!",1
Super convenient with bluetooth and has very good sound for the money.,1
This is our first high tech remote control and it's easy to use; no batteries needed. I highly recommend buying one for any tv.,1
Received this very quick. Worked exactly as advertised,1
head phone demo at store sounded much better than what I got but live and learn. Have spent a bit of money at best buy very dissapointed,1
Great product!,1
"The Slingbox M2 works great as long as you have a wired connection or good steady wi-fi on your streaming device. Unfortunately, when used in an apartment complex with severe wi-fi interference, the signal tends to drop out, and the connection needs to be restored or restarted. As this is no longer an issue for me, the device is working great, but buyer beware!",1
"I had two pair of these installed in my 04' Dodge Dakota 4 door pickup. I had the Geek Squad install them and am very satisified all around. I'm still using the factory deck and am very impressed. The mids and highs are great and the base is good for a 6.5"" speaker running on a factory deck.",1
Purchased this tv to replace an older non-smart in the bed area of the master. This exceeds the Samsung on the office side. It has great picture and sound with updated apps. Love the purchase.,1
I needed more speed and space for gaming and this was a great add.,1
"The sound is so crisp and clear, it's hard to believe it's a single small speaker, it's perfect for my backyard gatherings. Everyone was so amazed by the sound.",1
Everything I want in a pair of head phones. Better than I expected.,1
"Mad my CPU. Perform with more quickness especially when playing games, or for office programs.",1
I had to upgrade my slingbox from the classic due to my directv box upgrade. It does the job well. There are some streaming hiccups here and there but I think it may be my network. The Mac app doesn't work with this slingbox but the web browser does work. The iOS apps still work fine with this one.,1
Fits great. Great magnetic connection. Protects screen. Real keys (some keyboards are completely flat). Bought my husband one after I used this and liked it.,1
3rd expensive but works well most of the time. Sometimes it doesn't change all devices property.,1
This mount is sturdy and easy to install. Good range of motion for screen.,1
"This speaker is well worth the money. Very loud and has good bass. Feels durable and well put together. Also purchased the smaller model for my mother. There is a clear difference between the two, but the smaller model is also high quality and worth the money.",1
"The Lowepro 300 offers great storage and protection for my Canon D70 and 3 lens, only complaints is that I would have liked more room for something like a tablet.",1
I have 5 other over the ear headphones. These are in a class of their own. Build quality and sound is amazing. I would recommend these to any audiophile!,1
"I use this speaker as part of a multi-room wireless setup for music throughout the house. The sound is very rich, and great for mids and highs. Amazing coming from such a relatively small speaker. There's an Extra Bass setting for heavy bass- but it sounds great and has plenty of bass as-is so I leave that feature turned off. If turned on it's too bass-heavy at higher volumes in my opinion. I have larger speakers and subs for that. I would highly recommend this speaker, even as a stand-alone portable unit as it can definitely hold its own, and it can be paired to another one for double the power. It's also VERY sturdy, it's got some heft to it as its interior is of steel construction, not cheap plastic. There are all sorts of settings you can select from using the Sony app for iOS or Android. It automatically turns on when activated via Apple AirPlay/Spotify/GoogleCast/Bluetooth (when you have the standby feature turned on) and it automatically turns off after 15 minutes of not being used. But you can adjust either feature using the app, amongst other options for sound, battery, network name, auto or manual updating via WiFi, etc. etc. This is obviously not a cheap speaker, so I'd never take it to the beach for example - I'd buy a much cheaper speaker for that!",1
I bought this remote to replace my 7 year old Harmony One. I like the favorites tabs that you can add. No more typing the numbers.,1
"Great for a 60 in TV. Not as much movement as I thought, but still is nice",1
This is a great buy. The sound is excellent for the money spent.,1
It is a very nice stereo,1
"Did not need full control as with the Elite model, so this was the best alternative to having control of multiple systems within the barn.",1
This is my third remote in 7 years- love all of them and like having the latest one- I have a 11 device theatre and all connected to this one remote! Awesome!,1
I have a Surface Pro 3 that I use for work and a Surface Pro 4 for personal. The SP4 type cover is a lot nicer than the 3 is. The key spacing feels better. I like the added finger print sensor for easier sign in.,1
"Does everything you need it to and more, wouldn't use any other universal remote.",1
This is a fantastic remote-easy to use and does everything it is suppose to,1
Universal remote control excellent,1
"Very easy to program! Just put in your devices by model number and tell it where everything is connected (e.g. DVD is on input 1 on the TV). The software download from the Internet. Worked great on my MacBook Pro 15 (late 2013). You need to plug in the remote to program it (they call it sync) once everything is setup and it includes a USB to micro USB cable, so if you have a laptop with the new USB C connector, you will need to use an adaptor or buy a new cable, so new MacBook Pro (late 2016+) and MacBook users will need to figure out a cable solution.The Ultime One is IR, it doesn't include the RF base, but the base can be bought separately at a later date if you decide you need RF.We have Roku 3 and 4 players, which use RF on their included remotes, however the Roku player can receive IR too, but it's not as responsive as it is with RF. You also need to point the remote at the player, which you may not be used to if you use the Roku remote a lot. My daughter complained at first but I removed the battery from the old tv and Roku remotes (so they don't leak over time) and put them away, so she has to use the Logitech. After a few days she adapted to having to point the remote. Hopefully your significant other or kids are as flexible )The touch screen is responsive and easy to use. You can swipe over from the actions screen to the gesture screen and use it to easily raise or lower the volume (swipe up or down on the screen instead of using the volume up down buttons). It works great and so far I'm very happy with the purchase.1 star reduction because of the lower IR output requiring aiming more to use it.",1
needed something to make an I pad loader to teach a dance class,1
Excellent speaker for outdoor activities even in windy conditions like the beach,1
This is our 3rd Samsung. Very pleased with it.You will be too!,1
"I travel a great deal on airplanes and had been given a pair of Beats Studios by my employer as a gift a couple years back. The ear cups on the beats and the battery were failing so I decided to look into a new set of headphones for the plane. I never was a huge fan of how the Beats sounded, but the noise cancellation was decent and, on long flights, I prefer headphones over my custom earphones. Now, having the JBLs, I realize that the Noise Cancellation was very poor on the beats, and as I said before, they really didn't sound that good.I really love my new JBL headphones! the sound quality rivals my favorite cabled headphones, my Shure 440s/840s(depending if I want the hyped bottom end), and the fact that they are wireless makes them so much less cumbersome on flights. (they will function as cabled phones also if the battery dies, just no noise cancellation. The Beats would not function if the battery died.)If you are looking for a superb set of phones with great(even adjustable) noise cancellation, I highly recommend the JBL Everest Elite 700 series. Amazing buy!",1
"The keypad itself is excellent. But I need to issue a warning. Since I'm using a corporate login, I can't use the finger print part (or at least have not yet figured out how to use it for my corporate login).",1
"Alpine is a go to brand for my audio needs, quality sound!",1
It was false advertising. Shows Howard and football on box but you can't get on the receiver. Very disappointed,1
"I've had several universal remotes and there's always one or a few things that don't work on each or some of your components With this remote, everything works and is responsive. The interface is a little confusing at first but once you understand it, it's great.",1
"I read lots of reviews, and I was very confused, so maybe this will help others. Bass, this has it, but it is accurate and clean, so for ""bassheads"", this won't be enough, get a sub already. For everyone else, it will be fine. I put 4 in a ford ranger PU and it sounds great with a pioneer head unit, no EQ or loudness in use, very clean, neutral, and sounds deeper than the rated 50 something HZ lower limit would make you think. I'm very happy, and if you like clean and balanced (ie. correct) sound, you will too.",1
"not good for the price, did not meet sound volume and sound quality",1
I was searching for a computer that could efficiently run the AUTOCAD suite and Microsoft Office. I can truly say the Dell XPS with the intel core i7 processor has more than been up to the challenge. I am running a demanding program like the AUTOCAD suite and Microsoft Office without sacrificing any speed or quality. I am incredibly impressed with this computer and highly recommend it for users who may have similar needs for performance.,1
nice,1
I love it. Alexa is hard headed sometimes but I'm glad 8t bought here,1
I have a question for Sony it's about the subwoofer the sound that comes out of it is very low I can hear the bass but the person is singing you can barely here it. Is that what it's supposed to sound like I just bought everything else works good I love it. Just wanna know maybe I got a defective item.,1
"Excellent picture, blackest blacks, OS seems stable and intuitive, apps look and feel great. Typical Samsung quality, would recommend.",1
Easy and efficient way to control television; sound bar; DVD player ... has built-in 'Help' menu for when I become confused!Really like this control: easy to operate and understand.,1
Picture is perfect and works as advertised. Used from different starts on cell data.,1
I would definitely recommend these headphones. The sound quality is amazing and the fit is very comfortable.,1
This product is only good to use if the main TV is never used. It will change the channel on the main TV. There is nothing too great about this. Off to college and you want to keep your room cable then maybe this fits you. Honestly you are off to college you should save your parents a few bucks and let them cancel your service.,1
"Purchased the sony DV cassette for a church ceremony, it worked great, easy to use.",1
"I am going to start by saying this was not the first surround sound system I have ever purchased but it is the best. I got this to upgrade my game-room/theater-room. I had an older Sony System that still worked but was showing its age so I moved it off to my wife's TV and got this. Let me tell you the difference in unreal. The quality of the sound is much improved over the old Sony Speakers and my Kenwood speakers before that. Also, the wires and equipment to hook the system to the amplifier are top notch. Nice heavy duty speaker wire is provided which is flexible to make it easy for setup. this is not my first Bose purchase but it is the first surround sound system I have gotten from the company. I will be hard pressed to buy sound equipment from another company going forward. FYI, I did hook the Bose System to a new Sony Amplifier because they give years of trouble free use.",1
Love it,1
"Name Brand TV at competitive price. Though, this unit has an issue with Streaming Audio from any HDMI sources or web apps which is resolved with firmware update 1147. If you Audio drops in/out get the firmware update. Samsung will send free USB or you can download from site to a USB. This is assuming your TV isn't networked.",1
"Good memory that was available on the shelf, easy install",1
We needed a Television for or game room and after looking on line at several stores I knew Best Buy would be the best buy for us! After arriving at the store the first Television I saw in the front of the store was a 60 inch samsung for $599.00 I thought it was a mistake...but it was not and I bought it immediately..after best Buy delivered my TV my brother mounted and set up everything and the picture is awesome..we are so happy and satisfied!,1
It was a great sounding little speaker. Maybe to many features for the average bluetooth buyer. But If your into HIFI this speaker is for you,1
Logitech - Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Remote is the Best Remote i ever had So Smart touch screen very easy to setup and use !,1
"I love this stereo system! Has so many nifty features! The choices of equalizers is really nice. The only thing that surprises me, is that a stereo system of this quality has only one cd capability. Wish it held more than that, but would not keep me from buying it! The volume goes up to 50 max, and holds it's sound, without any trouble. If your looking for a powerful system, this baby has it and more! I love mine!",1
It has good battery life. It cold b a little louder,1
"It replaced 5 remotes for different devices. Easy to program. Easy to use. My whole family can now run all the equipment (tv, DVR, cable box, receiver, Apple TV, video games) without me!",1
"Amazing sound, set up was quick, did update and it just worked. Many ways to connect. Google cast feature so useful and easy. I love the surround sound set up option and multi room compatibility",1
Used for outdoor listening. Has plenty of power with good clarity,1
"We have always bought Harmony remotes and Were very happy with them. However, this remote is a Big disappointment. Not easy to Set up. Not easy to use at all. To much screen swiping to get to the function you want. Screen is too sensitive. Buttons are small and easy to mistress. Not happy with his purchase. I do not recommend.",1
"We bought the remote for a closed door cabinet based on the description. Unfortunately after receiving the remote and before opening the package, we read that you must purchase another device for that feature to work. It was quickly returned.",1
I bought two about a month ago because I wanted to connect our desktops to the home network - it is working great and connected very easily.,1
This is a great product and it met or exceeded all my expectations,1
"Strong, sturdy and convenient is this wall TV mount. Very flat to the wall and 10 inches out to access the back if necessary on those moments that you really needed to access. Price was great and I would buy from Sanus again.",1
"Bought this to hang my Samsung 55"" tv, very easy to mount and looks great!",1
"I bought this to replace a first generation Harmony One - I prefer the old Harmony's user interface - more real buttons - the new Ultimate also has odd touch screen responses - jumps home theatre set up without logical step - i.e. mine will jump from playing a Bluray to CD playback just altering the Home Theatre processor. IT is a decent multi-device remote. I sense drive to reduce cost by going to more multi-purpose soft switches is just annoying to this old timer. However one VERY positive input - LOGITECH's support group - they go the EXTRA mile to resolve issues, quickly, proficiently, very comforting to know they are available and driven to serve.",1
"This is our second remote of this model. It is small, works great and the charge cradle rocks. We hated the usb cable lying around and falling off the table when not in use.",1
"Bought this for our 15 year-old and he loves it. It has a lot of bass, the battery last a long time, and he enjoys messing with the light colors with his phone.Personally, I'd want a speaker with more mid-range. This has a lot of highs and lows, but the middle is rather weak. Its designed for the pop music he listens to and represents it very well; but for other styles you might want something different.",1
The speakers I purchased were a great price and sound amazing! I have a lot of people ask me if I have a subwoofer in my car and I am happy to say I do not. The speakers pack that much punch and keep me jammin' on my commute to work!,1
"The product is outstanding, it has great sound, I've took it on hikes, the beach, pool side and even the steam room at my gym. I recommend this speaker to all my friends.",1
"great sound, was very easy to connect to phone with bluetooth",1
"These headphones Rock! When I'm using them I can't hear a single thing around me, which is nice cause I don't lose my husband and my kid.",1
I got these speakers for surround speakers. They had to be recharged every two days and had very weak sound out of them. Sony needs to come up with a blue tooth speaker that plugs into the wall and give out better sound.,1
Great remote. Looks great. Definitely worth the money,1
I upgraded my 3 year old Mac Mini from 2 GB to 8 GB of RAM...works like a new machine. Well worth the investment.,1
I previously owned the Solo version of slingbox for over 6 years but wanted hd broadcast on my big tv at my shop so i got the M2 slingbox and it is super easy to install just download and install software and withing a few minutes i was up and running the picture looks amazing in hd when i sling to my tv at my shop using a Roku ..,1
"Not only is the RAM excellent, but Best Buy price matched Amazon on it. I love Best Buy",1
This is a great product once you get it all set up. The set up process is a bit time consuming but once it is up and running it works great. If you are a tech junkie like me you will love this remote.,1
I would definitely recommend this product to upgrade your computer.,1
"When first used, it was great! Subsequently, the device stopped working, requiring Geek Squad assistance which means a complicated scheduling process, and ultimately, extra expense. Settle for a simpler device, the software for this one seems too complex, requiring multiple software updates that don't always correct the problem.",1
"What a great remote to eliminate the mess of remotes from the cable box, TV, entertainment system, Blue ray etc. I have one and purchased this for a family member.",1
"I like the device, it's great. Has options on tfhe screen. It replaced the wifi in my store. Though Verizon slows your data after 10gbs",1
Nothing but top quality sound from these speakersEasy install,1
"Great radio, especially for someone who hates CDs and uses their phone for music. Simple menu navigation. Overall easy to operate.",1
"The ILX is a perfect extension of the iPhone for the car. Although the list of apps that can take full advantage of CarPlay is limited (I don't expect Google Maps support any time soon), my in-car infotainment experience has vastly improved.",1
Great addition to my church speaker system. May one day use a pair in my patio system,1
This worked just it should and very good for the price,1
"Using this with a Sony BD player and Onkyo 5.1 amp linked via coax audio TV via HDMI. After all settings were completed, the action and big explosions sounded great. If you listen to movies using TV speakers, you don't know what you're missing.BUT I couldn't hear dialog. Checked all settings, and searched online forums. I tried to boost the dB for the center but still couldn't hear. Speakers are connected via Monster Cable instead of the flimsy speaker cable provided (so small the connectors won't even hold it). Then I used the test tone from the amp to find out the center channel speaker doesn't work. I'm using an existing bookshelf speaker for center for now.Otherwise, the bases sound fine and rest of the speakers seem more than powerful enough for my tiny home theater room. Watched Journey to the Center of the Earth in 3-D with 6-year old, and the combination 3-D video and 3-D audio were a winner with him.For a small room, with a decent amp and proper cables (do yourself a favor, and get at least 16-gauge) this set should work just fine for most movie lovers. Audiophiles should look elsewhere. And test all speakers before you throw out the packaging (as I did).UPDATE: after mentioning to Amazon the center channel was not working but I didn't want to pack everything up, they promptly shipped me a new set FOC - with pre-paid return as well. Next day. New center channel works great, and sound has greatly improved. Nicely done!UPDATE 02/17/2012 (3 years later): Have had absolutely no issues with this speaker set. I just purchased a new Onkyo receiver and was looking for additional speakers, because they have held up so well. My family enjoys watching movies and we use these at least 30 hours a week.Read more",1
Use with Roku Streaming Stick and SlingPlayer App to watch on TV without having to rent another cable box. Is also great to be able to stream and watch TV on phone or tablet when away from home.,1
"So far so good! Looks good, good speed. Haven't put it through it's paces yet but I'm loving it so far!!",1
The remote work when it wanted to. It would turn things on when it wasn't supposed to and it was awkward to hold.,1
This new tv was very user friendly to connect to my receiverAnd the quality is exceptional,1
"Have been using this remote for about four days. Cost prohibitive to some, but has made using our entertainment center so much easier to use. We went from 8 remotes, down to ONE. It even controls our ceiling fan. GET OUT OF THE CITY. Highly recommended!!!!!",1
"Works as advertised, but I liked my original Harmony remote better. The flat buttons and touch screen mean you have to look at the remote when using it. I liked being able to feel what I was doing on my original Harmony. Also, my charging dock broke after 14 months.",1
Easy to use does not require wires can accomodate multiple devices,1
The sound from this small speaker is unbelievable. Clarity is fantastic and it gets incredibly loud without distortion. Alexa built in is a great benefit as well. Battery life is great and it is waterproof.,1
Speakers were easy to install and the sound is awsome!,1
"I bought the flipside 300 for my Nikon D 7000. I now use with my D7200. Depending on where I am going and what I will be shooting, I carry different lenses. I have no trouble putting my camera and kit lens in this bag. I can also put a 70-300mm in also. Although a little tight I can put my camera with battery grip and a 150-600mm lens in it. I have found the flipside 300 to be well built. The materials and workmanship is second to none. I like the ability to move the dividers inside to suit my needs.",1
"I was planning on change my car audio for something simple, but when I found this one completely changed my mind the iPhone screen share works awesome",1
What a great remote!,1
"Used in recording public access videos - no glitches, reliable.",1
"Remote is flaky, hard to program and still can't get all features to work as they should so I'm using two remotes still.",1
Much faster with the internet and multiple devices,1
Got this to watch cable in a second home. Picture quality not as good as normal and sound can be a bit out of syncy when casting to a TV but annoying enough to wipe the smile off my face for not having to pay a second cable bill. No such issues when viewing on a mobil device.,1
An excellent replacement or supplement to manufacturer'so remote and certainly an enhancement.,1
"SIMPLE TO USE, SIMPLE TO HOOK UP TO MY LAPTOP, GREAT PRINT QUALITY.",1
"This is a great unit! I like controlling Pandora from the deck via Bluetooth. The mic it comes with for voice commands, calls and voice to text works really well. USB is a little picky on which drives it accepts. Wouldnt take a Toshiba 8g but did take a 32g PNY. Easy controls and looks nice too.",1
i hav had 3 dell desktops and went to bu my 4th. Had nothing but problems. 14 crashes in about a weeks time.Best Buy and geek squad were wonderful with taking it back and helping me find a replacement .Bec there were problems with the one on the floor for demos I switched to an HP.,1
"I spent weeks agonizing over my purchase. To spend untold amount of money for great headphones as opposed to a more realistic outcome for my money. I tried the Bose Bluetooth, Beats, Sony, Skullcandy headphones and for my money the JBL Elite 700 gives you the most bang for your buck. They are comfortable. Sound is excellent, comparable to the Bose, but significantly better than the Beats, Sony and Skullcandy. The JBL app lets you fine tune the headphones to your liking and is very user friendly. Battery life is incredible and the noise canceling feature (although Bose still leads in this area) is great considering the headphones are about 50 dollars less and the Bose doesn't even offer Noise Cancelation in their Bluetooth headphones.",1
"I bought this product to listen to music around the house, kitchen, bathroom, garage etc.... The sound is really good, battery last a long time, the bass is good. I would definitely recommend this product.",1
"I have a Samsung note, Mophie does not make battery packs for this so I had to try this battery pack. It was small, compact, easily charged and attractive.",1
"Since I don't have cable and use an XBox 360, plus a sound bar, watching TV used to be a three-remote affair, with all three having to be out if I wanted to change shows, change the volume, or power off any given device. I looked up universal remotes, and although a bit pricey, the Harmony One supported all my devices, and allowed me to program functionality on all of my devices into a single activity that I call ""Watch TV."" Now when I hit the ""Watch TV"" icon on the little LED screen, the TV, sound bar, and XBox all turn on at the same time, on the settings I would need to watch my shows. Furthermore, I don't need to switch to ""modes"" when using different devices, each button can be programmed to activate a device's function independent of the other devices in the chain. It is so massively convenient that even my tech-illerate mom could figure it out without any instruction from me.",1
It makes entering into the surface pro much faster and easier. The fingerprint reader works great as long as you keep it clean.,1
This amp is small and can be installed behind the radio. It has sufficient drive for some boom boom boom without being a nuisance to everyone else.,1
The keyboard is great and there's more space to type. The fingerprint is cool to have but needs more work doesn't always read my finger.,1
"I love this radio system. If you love your XM subscription, then you'll love this in your house or wherever you are. It is a must own.",1
I love this.produxt because my phone usually dies toward the end of the day and I am rarely around a.plug in. I can charge my phone where ever I am with this handy little device.,1
Easy to install and works great! We had an older one and upgraded and both have been wonderful products.,1
makes using my tablet easier. Not used to the touchscreen technology yet. just wish it had a number pad.,1
So much easier than three remotes,1
"This is a great remote, and setup is easy. I would absolutely recommend this.",1
"The program downloading process was simple, but the remote has yet to work. It can turn on and off the devices, but I can't get it to change channels on the tv. I am awaiting a member of the Geek Squad to fix it.",1
Works great very please excellant color and sound great service at store,1
"I took my time shopping for a new blue tooth speaker and I am so glad I did. You would not expect a Sony speaker to be on the level with Bose, JBL, etc. but amazingly this speaker tops all of the models that I listened to. I even went to 2 different Best Buy stores for a sanity check and sure enough the Sony wins by a mile!",1
"An overall good product for the price, especially due to its Bluetooth capability.",1
I have a 2 bay NAS which I use for a backup of pictures. I wanted a drive big enough so I wouldn't have to worry about space for a long time. So far these drive have preformed great.,1
"Headphones are best I have heard and are very comfortable . Quality soft leather ear cups, great highs and good bass make these quality headphones a joy",1
Great product very easy to follow instructions. It's not a bulky item and mounts easily to wall and television.,1
"use this primarily for air travel. and with the bluetooth feature, don't have to worry about dangling cords to get in the way. Sound quality better that average",1
"Having the ability to watch your favorite shows from wherever you are is amazing! As long as you have an internet connection, you're good!",1
Live how fast it charges my Samsung Galaxy Note 5....just wish the cable was longer,1
"I've been using this remote for about a year now, before that had a harmony one (which I miss, but we finally sat on it too many times and it broke)The good:I can use it to control my Apple TV, Tivo HD, Bluray player and receiver with ease. All the needed buttons seem to be there for with some left over for extra stuff. I've got the 30 sec skip forward and back programmed on the bottom buttons, as well as the Live TV button and cancel button for Tivo.You can setup your favorite channels as icons on the fly and sync them back to your computer.The help feature always seems to work for me when things mess up. The Harmony one often took several steps to correct the power if the TV went to sleep.Recharging dock is nice.It actually replaces all my other remotes.The disappointing:I miss having a hard number buttons. The screen is a poor replacement. You have to swipe several times to get the to software keyboard.The screen doesn't wake up when you move the remove like the Harmony One did. The touchscreen is too slow and doesn't feel responsive compared to a smartphone.The gestures are completely useless for controls.You have to swipe several times to get the to software keyboard.The setup software was a pain in the ass to get going. It used silver lite or some plugin in a browser. It would have been better as a native app. The software menus were confusing and some features seems exclusive when they shouldn't have been. I couldn't program a tivo button and something else. I had to get the tivo remote and program it as a custom button.The button signals are also too slow. I was able to shorten them in the software program, but only for favorite channel buttons. Turning things off from my TV mode takes 15 seconds or so, doesn't sound like much but feels like forever pointing it at the screen.While I could change speed of the favorite buttons punching in the numbers, I couldn't get it fast enough. I think the min time between presses was 200ms or something. I feel like I can punch in the numbers faster on my Tivo remote, if I wanted too. I should be able to make this faster but I couldn't in the software.Overall, if you have the money, get the Harmony remote with the hardware buttons (it cost 2X what this one does). This gets the job done, but leaves me feeling disappointed.",1
I love this! It's so great not having six remotes !!! This is the Best thing I ever bought !!,1
"The fingerprint part works well enough. The trackpad sucks. Coming from the great trackpads on Macs, I just don't understand why a Windows device can't have a nice smooth trackpad like Macs do. The keys are too firm for me compared to the Surface Pro 3 keyboard and my Mac keyboard. I returned this item.",1
Like to upgrade from 16gb to 32gb. Good looking too,1
"Simple set up, better reception than earlier models",1
The setup went well and hassle free. Operation of the machine is great since adding.,1
"This was a father's day gift for my husband. He loves it, battery lasts a long time and sound is amazing",1
"So far I've been pretty happy with the purchase, but found out after purchasing it, it does not have the capability to output 5.1 sound when streaming. I also had some issues when using Ethernet instead of wifi. Usually Ethernet is more reliable and faster, but that is not the case with my slingbox. I'm not sure if it is hardware or software, but I dropped connection all the time when using Ethernet, so I went back to using wifi and it works fine again.",1
Love the power and great sound! Crisp and clear music.,1
"I'm amazed at how well this works. It took a few minutes to hook it up and add the remote sensor that was included. I love being able to stream a sports show to my phone anywhere I can connect to the internet. It could use a little better menu when connecting, but I was able to figure it out in a few minutes.",1
"In Texas you never know when a storm is just a storm or something more. This weather radio is just what we needed. Now we don't worry, we know!",1
the speaker isn't big but it has great sound.it will work well for me.,1
great gaming mouse for someone that doesn't what a full end version of one just something responsive with extra features.,1
Bought as a gift on 9/10/17. Delivered on 9/13/17. Top of frame started separating from the screen on 9/21/17. Bummer. Should be better quality sold.,1
I got tired of fighting 5 different remotes to watch programs we liked. I bought this Harmony remote and life is so much easier! It replaced every remote in my entertainment center. Setup was fast and easy too! Every command from the original remotes is available and works on the Harmony remote. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to simplify their entertainment/multimedia center.,1
In order for me to get better ram I would have to order it and this doubled what the computer I bought had in it.,1
"Honestly less setup is better. I managed to get this working as a Cast device. I still can't figure out Bluetooth. Sony needs to dumify their stuff - go talk to Apple. Other than that, the sound is great.",1
"This is the worst remote we have ever had. The buttons don't work. It looks like it has more options, but it very frustrating to use. I'm love technology and would not recommend this to anyone",1
This will be the 2nd Harmony remote I have paid over 200 dollars for. Always struggled with the price but the 1st one lasted for years and they are so user friendly to operate. All round great product.,1
Great product and good service will do business again if necessary. Thanks Jake,1
"I purchased this item to be able to use as a hands-free device when making or receiving phone calls; however, the person couldn't hear me clearly. I chose to return this device because the feature, I would have used most, didn't work well. For this reason I deducted two stars. In terms of the sound quality for the bluetooth speaker - this has a reasonable sound.",1
Love the quality sound that is produced from this. I use it all the time whether its just casually in my small apartment or whem im in the garage working on things.,1
The radio does as it describes but make sure u not looking for a CD player cause it could be confusing by the display.,1
"Excellent expansion to expand my pcs memory from 16 GB to 32 GB. I probably didn't need it, but I really do love it.",1
The touch screen does not work when pressed on occasion. Sometimes it will go to another page instead of the commands on the page you are trying to use,1
Excellent sound quality and good bass on stock radio. Bass is impressive for a 5x7 when amplified. I also like how you can adjust the direction of the tweeter.,1
PNY is always a safe bet for BIY project...the system will probably not come close to using it all but WTH that's part of the fun!,1
AWESOME!!!!! Couldn't have chosen a better product!,1
"This is an update from a previous review. I have had this remote for about a year now and it is absolute garbage. There is not one single time that it operates as programed and I don't have to use the help button to finish the programmed function. The remote has been programmed multiple times and all of the functions work but not with the push of one button like it's supposed to, you always have to use help. This remote is a complete let down and a waste of 250. Do not waste your money.",1
Love these sound great and are really loud and sound clear.perfect for both music and movies.,1
All in good remote. Easy to program and cool features. Battery is a bit to be desired but all in a good high end remote,1
Wonderful color great picture easy hook-up who recommend this to my friends great price,1
I got this through the vine program.We already have the Ultimate + hub for our living room. So I got this for our bedroom setup.Set up. Amazingly easy and the Logitech database of electronics they can support is extensive and even had my old Westinghouse monitor. Updating the firmware is painless too.Use. This is where Logitech comes up a little short thus the 4 stars. The touch screen is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Sometimes when I swipe or click a button it works and other times it doesn't. I really don't know what I am doing wrong. But the touch screen and the several pages (swipe left/right) really makes things convenient.Also provides the 30 second fast forward for my Comcast DVR and 15 second jump back.An incredibly impressive piece of hardware. Battery life is great. And firmware updates come fast and regularly.,1
"I have owned and tried Sennheiser Momentum, P5, P3, Klipsch 4i, Etymotics, Grado's, Shure's, and more... Obvsoily these are a combination of in-ear, open and closed headphones.Bottom line...I have NEVER had my hands on ANY type of ear/headphone that sounded as good, nearly as beautifully made, and comfortable as these. I would be surprised if they don't wind up in MOMA in NYC like Movado's.Sound Quality specifics...2nd to none instrument/voice separation with close but awesome soundstage, tight and appropriately strong bass, great mid-range, unbelievable and again appropriate highs (again 2nd to none), many people claim you can hear new details with certain gear - with these OH MY YOU WILL, isolation is great while actively listening and does a great job of shielding sound from outsiders.They are so efficient that my ipad and phone drive them as loud as I could bear - amazing for such large over the ear drivers.If you love music and sound at it's best and love to get ""lost"" in it, I know of no better place on earth unless you are prepared to spend well into 4 digits.The only downside...$400 is a lot of money, especially for headphones. However, I can safely say they blow away anything in this price range and they are physically a work of art. Lastly, they smell beautiful, really. Other reviewers have described the smell similar to what the inside of a ""Bentley"" or ""Rolls Royce"". It seems crazy to say it but it is no exaggeration, really.",1
"As always, excellent service from Best Buy, this is the second speaker I get and when you sinc them the sound is awesome.",1
Have a I- mac desktop p.c. Only had 4 m. Of ram was able to increase to 16 . For a little over $125. Worth the money for the up grade.,1
"TV watching simplified. Little issues every now and then, but not a deal breaker.",1
Handles a wide variety of device combinations. Touch screen controls may be accidentally selected (use locking feature to minimize bad effects). It is wise to include all available devices in each selection to allow continued operations on one device when switching to view another.,1
I love these so much I actually bought two of them. They are amazing.,1
Great with the iPhone 6 and it gives out great sound,1
Miss my now broken harmony one. Not a huge fan of the LCD. Kinda sensitive and it also doesn't have the signal strength as the old one. Has to be pointed directly at my receiver to change channels. Bring back the old harmony remote.,1
Lots of features I bought 1 for my car and a 2nd 1 for my utv. The bluetooth feature works perfectly with my work phone that is an iphone 6 and my personal phone a Note 4 i have not had any connection issues and the price is really nice.,1
It's a pretty awesome remote. My husband programmed it and all in all its fairly easy to use,1
Easy to attach to tablet good size keys finger print id good idea,1
"I have been a fan of Logitech Harmony remotes for a while. Our old ""One"" was starting to fail after several years so I looked into a new one. This is much more compact, the touch screen is easy, and even the set up is easier online. The only ""negative"" is that it needs to have the battery recharged pretty often even though it's not really doing anything. Easy enough if you always keep it in the charging cradle (which is also pretty slick). Thus the 4 instead of 5 stars.Highly recommend!!!",1
"I have been using Logitech items for quite a while from mice to previous remotes. I was offered the chance to review this item and my impressions are favorable.1. What's in the box You receive the remote, plus the charging cradle and a brief instruction booklet.2. Aesthetic: I have the previous Harmony One remote and in comparison this unit is smaller. It is simply much more compact. The first obvious difference is the lack of a numerical keyboard. Second, this unit is designed to sit vertically in the charger (as opposed to horizontally with the previous model). Also, the off button, and many of the buttons are quite a bit smaller. The bottom side has a nice, rough material that seems resistant to slipping.3. Use: First off, I charged the remote for a while (a couple of hours) before doing anything. Once I got the unit turned on, I was directed to add information. I must confess that because I had a previous Harmony, the process of adding information was simple. However, one positive aspect is the account for adding information (and that is adding the components of your system and needs by each activity (TV, DVD, videogame console, etc) has been moved off from a computer based server, to a cloud based server. I did need to upgrade my account to the cloud by registering, but the cloud seemed to understand my need to upgrade and simply asked for a connection through the included USB cord and transferred the information. Advantage While I have my laptop, if for some reason my laptop takes a dive, I can use another computer to upgrade my remote easily.Actual use: Once I got everything squared away, I turned on the TV with the remote and began to figure this system out. This is quite a change from the previous remote. The touchscreen in the middle is a important part of the system. There are two buttons at the top ( a star (for favorite channels (easy to set up based on TV provider and channels available) and a Home button for activities). Once the thing is on you can switch between favorite channels, activities, a number pad, and a command page by swiping around. Also, there is a swipe on the bottom for bringing up the gestures page which enables the user to pause, play and change volume (amongst other functions).Nicely, there are buttons on the remote that make the touch-screen duplicative.In many ways, this system is a huge improvement over the previous version. I was originally not able to understand the system, but after a bit of use, the ways of this remote become pretty intuitive. I love how you can easily go to things like a help function (more on that in a bit), a devices button and ways to adjust the remote on the fly without having to access the cloud to update the remote.What things didn't I like (There are only a few things that are irritating on this remote based on my use. First off, I really wish that the remote didn't have the IR outlet on the bottom as opposed to the top like the previous remote. As this seems to be line of sight, which sometimes means that I have to hold the remote upwards rather than simply pointing (for some this is probably okay, but for me this seems dorky)). UPDATE: Once I posted this review, someone thoughtfully pointed out that my supposed complaint about the IR sensor being on the bottom was incorrect and actually that button is for the remote learning function. In fact, I simply had to point the remote at the system as always. Guess what Using the remote with the remote pointed at the system worked extremely well. Gone were the second presses and the irritations that the remote would miss some function. It works and I haven't had a problem since. So this is NOT a problem at all.Another irritation is that I think this remote makes it harder to have a older person or less techy person at the home as the help button is buried in the sub-menu instead of being readily available for those not familiar with the system. Though this is not something that occurs often, it is something I think about and I think this was a bad mistake (if you have older parents coming over this will be an issues).Overall: In many ways this is a great remote. I have really come to appreciate the touch-screen and the levels of menus accessible with this remote. Although there are some irritations, I still think this is a very nice remote and well worth the purchase to make things more simplistic with the home theater (who needs 5 remotes). With that in mind, I really really like this item, but I don't love it yet based on the quibbles above. This doesn't mean that are better solutions around, because I haven't seen them.++++Update: After some extensive use and modification, I am really starting to LOVE this item. The ability to make some slight changes without having to hook this up to the computer is terrific (such as modifying icon placements, start positions and similar things, this makes life easier) as well as the overall use, which as I become more used to the functions, becomes far easier. This is a great update and I am hiving some fun with even being able to modify individual icons on the channels. Awesome! The software package makes this incredibly easy to do, unlike the previous iteration which was far tougher.",1
Just amazin,1
Bought it to watch football while away! Works awesome!!,1
Perfect upgrade to factory OEM speakers! These have plenty of highs and great amount of bass. I would definitely purchase these again in the future.,1
Had a little trouble with setup had an old version on the software on my computer. After that the remote works great!!,1
"Not sure why they do not package these with the surface, but a must have. The fingerprint login is VERY nice.",1
It looks good and easy to move around.,1
Great radio easy to use and understand love this radio so much great sound quality and amazing how easy it hooks to iPhone.,1
Omg we live our new remote. Previously we had 4 which was confusing.. now one does it all,1
"The price of these headphones was a little high, but in the end they were worth it and compared to other headphone at this price I prefer these and the case is just a little bonus added",1
"Good remote but seems to struggle remembering how to switch modes on certain devices. Then again, I only had one day to work with it before I left for an extended trip so maybe when I'm able to fine tune it I might see better results.",1
Works well. Love it. Much better than what I had previously,1
This is a Great TV! I love Samsung! Great color and crispness etc. Only issue is WI-FI randomly loses connection & have to manually reconnect,1
Speaker is exactly what i ws looking for and was inexpensive,1
Nice upgrade compared to my harmony 650. Has way more features,1
Very complicated but hard to use ... Wish the tutorial would go away forever,1
Excelent,1
My housing needed a little modification but other than that they are GREAT!,1
"Great speakers and phenomenal sound. They have a magnetic plate, very practical.",1
"Bought this stereo last Christmas and have been reasonably satisfied so far. Had a couple of Kenwoods before that that were junk. The controls were really complicated and hard to see and the signal reception was poor. Overall pretty lousy machines. I picked this particular brand because of its ability to grab stations and hold on to them which is a necessity in north GA where signals fade in and out all the time because of the moutains. One complaint. The channel knob is made of ridiculously cheap plastic, thin plastic. Hope it holds up. We'll see.",1
"This was the most flush to the wall full motion mount. So nice to move it around to access the wires etc. Bolts were a little long or too short that came with the kit for my 55"" Samsung (2015 model), so I had to cut the longest set with hack saw. One thing to mention make sure you have a recessed outlet so that the mount can be all the way against the wall. Those are about $9 and easy to install.",1
not to bad for the price. you have to be pretty close to the router though to get a great signal,1
"i bought this started 5.1 surround setup to go with my new Yamaha 5.1 receiver, definitely not disappointed. They work perfectly for my smaller TV room and the bass is amazing on the subwoofer. Can't believe these were only $150, cheaper than a single speaker in most cases.",1
The app is excellent. Can adjust the sounds from app. But I wanted to use them for gym also. They do get a little warm with time. Fit is good. Sound is good after some adjusting from app. Battery life as advertised. Noise canceling is ok. But at price point prefer the Bose QC35 and Sennheiser Momentun 2. The app for this one better tho. Sound is good.,1
I've been using PNY ram in all my recent builds and this set is top quality for my z170 chipset motherboard would highly recommend.,1
Great Sound would highly recommend it,1
So easy to attach to the computer...love that iwhen it is connected it does not disconnect easy,1
"Sensitive mic makes it easy to get Alexas attention, but theres no easy indicator to tell if it recognizes your voice. Speaker qualities are fantastic: surround sound, casting/streaming/bluetooth capabilities, light and portable and can withstand drops. A great buy!",1
"I really would have preferred the polks, but they don't seem to be carried in stores anymore (at least not the one near me), but I was pleasantly surprised by these. They aren't -quite- at the point the difference from mp3 and flac files are noticeable, but it does pick up some distinctions at the high frequencies which is rather impressive for a 6x8. The lower frequencies were about equal though for the two file types (however in their defense I actually have trouble on lower frequencies on my home system that have drastic differences in audio quality on the two file types), but still, they are just perfect for a commute speaker.",1
this is a nice unit to have is a backup for when my battery goes dead. I use it when I'm not able to get to a charger can usually get about two charges out of it.I would recommend this as a backup. does not take too long to charge.,1
"This was purchased as an upgrade from a Surface Pro-3 type cover. The spacing and style of the keys on the new model is far superior to the Pro-3 cover. The larger touchpad is a plus, much better than the original. The fingerprint reader works intermittently, disconnecting the keyboard and reattaching it will usually ""jar"" it back into functionality.",1
Works for my house size..... Simple and sweet in Bose home theater packages.,1
"If you like old school type audio products then these are the headphones for you. Sound quality was superior to many other premium brand products including Sennheiser, AKG, and Dennon. Durable well made product which feels as good as it looks.",1
"Great headphones for a great price, I love the fact that they are wireless and noise cancelling.",1
Not very user friendly. A bit cumbersome to use. There are better Logitech remotes out there.,1
I am loving my new Surface and this keyboard makes the Surface that must more user friendly. I love being able to fingerprint log in instead of typing in the password each time and being able to adjust the lighted background of the keyboard is really nice. I love the feel and text of the keyboard itself and I am extremely happy with the quality.,1
"It's really nice that you can hook up iPad, iPod and phone to use wireless.",1
Good sound. Easy to use and pleased with product!!,1
"Love it. This is 3rd harmony remote we've purchased, the only brand I'll buy.",1
"It is quick, and was a good price from Best Buy. My former dell torched the mother board. Fortunately, Best Buy had one on the shelves.",1
Got these along with a set of Alpine SPE-6090s and a Pioneer DEH-X6500BT head unit & it sounds really great.,1
"The Slingbox M2 works as advertised. You'll need to download the free app for your phone or tablet. I would have given it 5 stars, except the M2 could not authenticate using the wireless mode with WPA2 Personal encryption and a long wifi password. (Mine is over 50 characters.) Short passwords worked, but are less secure, and in my case, I was unwilling to change the passwords on all my other wireless devices to accommodate this design defect. So, I elected to connect the M2 via an ethernet cable instead.",1
"Outstanding, tight bass with clear treble. Great definition and very functional noise cancelling. Buttons need work (UI is confusing; hold down 3 secs to turn on, etc.) and cords (USB and 3.5mm Stereo) are way too short. Case fits a bit tight.",1
"Spent two weeks and maybe 10 hours of actual research time on Internet to get to full operation. Impossible to live with if hub is not used. Works great after the job was done. Most people would have given up but I have a wife and she badgered me until it worked perfectly. I think that the technical issues are slowly being addressed by Logitech as this new series of remotes are coming out. Harmony Elite version with hub is simpler, system took about 5 min and is awesome.",1
"Have owned these 3 months and the right side is starting to cut out. I use them about 8-9 hours a day while sitting at desk at work. Other than that issue, they are good headphones.",1
"Good product, easy to setup, battery life isn't amazing but not bad either.",1
"Probably one of the worst products I've ever purchased. Extremely inconsistent with wi-fi. It rarely works, and when it does, streaming is variable and disconnections are frequent. I've tried different ISPs and routers, all to no avail. Customer service is non-existent. I would definitely suggest not purchasing a Slingbox product unless you are prepared to ethernet it directly..",1
We had a minimum of 3 remotes just to watch a simple TV program. Using the website (and app) - we found the settings for all the different devices! Now just one button and you are on the station you wanted to watch. Note - this is a replacement remote and after creating a new identity was able to migrate all the programming with the supplied wizard within the app.,1
"The Slingbox M2 was relatively easy to set up.The only drawback was the difficulty placing IR reader to ensure control of the box and I am only able to view the guide up to channel 100. I am able to view channels above 100 by pressing the numbers on the remote in the app. Once adjusted appropriately, it's not much of a problem.The picture quality is amazing on the phone, but on the Roku 3 it sometimes has the pixelating view watching sports. Overall great investment, allowing you to watch your local channels whenever you're away from home.",1
The sound clarity of these are phenomenal. Bass reproduction could be a little better but is not distorted. Overall very happy with the purchase.,1
"I researched these pretty well before buying them, reading reviews and discussing different options with friends. It was between these and Bose, and it was actually the Best Buy salesman who sold me on the JBL, which is what he owned. I bought them specifically for flying and I couldn't be more pleased. I was on a couple of smaller (noisy) planes recently and these were great.",1
Really like the finger print scan feature and the bigger spaces between the keys.,1
"I love this remote. I am still trying to learn all the buttons a little different than old harmony, but better",1
It is great has about 3 to 4 days of active use. the cord is braided,1
"I absolutely love this keyboard, and I don't think it deserves a two star rating, but the durability is horrendous. This is a purely aesthetic keyboard, and there are now multiple tears on the edges of the fabric which completely ruins it (and triggers my OCD :3), and the trackpad has two noticeable scratches. My backpack has a pouch meant for laptops, so I am not just throwing it in a bag with pencils poking at it. I am hesitant to recommend this product unless you look to treat your SP4 with the utmost care.",1
I have an F150 and these sound great in my truck!!,1
It works fine but just a little annoyed that I have to buy a new unit for the new Fire TV instead of using my other unit.,1
I live in an apartment. Great sound strong sub woofer. Sony remote is quality.,1
WORKS AS EXPECTED only downfall is there are no back light for the buttons...like FF RW PLAY,1
"the touch screen to change channels when watching TV is frustrating. Also you have to leave the device pointed directly at the TV, cable box and dvd or it may only partially follow your commandDisappointing for $250",1
Greatest customer service. Good sale going on. Love the sound,1
This speaker is great for training classes and presentations!,1
"Lots of nice feature, recommend using their online tool for awesome placement on wall",1
"I purchased this a couple of months ago, has the features I wanted and the CarPlay works well with my I phone.",1
"So I got a new surface 4 and it'd be crazy not to have a keyboard. The keys are springy, but they are a bit click-y so don't think you're going to type like a ninja. I was bummed it only came in black with the fingerprint ID but it works well so it was worth the trade off.",1
compliments my restroom and living room system. love it,1
"This headphones plays music clearly, eliminates noise from outside.",1
I bought this for my daughter and it is working great. Her old one has not been operating for about 2 years and I finally said that I would buy one. The only important items she had on her old one was her photos. I had the Geek Squad remove the hard drive and transfer all photos to the new computer. Thank goodness it still worked.,1
We recently moved to FL from NY and our new neighbors suggested we invest in a weather alert radio. We are so happy that we took their advice. In just one month it has already given us two local tornado warnings and numerous severe thunderstorm alerts. We sleep soundly knowing that if severe weather comes during the night we will be awakened in time to take cover if necessary. Wouldn't be without this product!,1
This was part of an overall stereo system I purchased for my car. The sound is great!,1
This is the most complicated and difficult remote I have ever worked with. The screen is too sensitive or not sensitive enough! It is difficult to program and the direction are so difficult to understand you just want to throw them in the trash along with the remote. I have a friend who is employed as a computer tech and they could not figure it all out! What a mess!,1
"These are a perfect fit for Fords. I paired them with the Kicker Hideaway sub, and could not be more pleased. They don't have alot of bass response on their own so a sub is recommended. But they are crystal clear.",1
"Works OK. A replacement to a Harmony One, which was much better. There is a numeric keypad to enter channels but the sensitivity if very bad, so by the time you get the channel in it has changed to the first 1 or 2 numbers. Virtually impossible to get in 3 digits before it changes channels.",1
"The headphone sound output is great, and with the app or allows you to change what the smart key does, one thing I didn't like was that it pressed down from the top of my head, and after about an hour my head hurts, so I would recommend these headphones for people with smaller heads or wider heads them people with tall heads, like myself",1
"They sound great. The app that is free to download also is fantastic and easy to use. Only complaint is the carrying pouch it comes with. For premium headphones, I feel like there should be a hardcase.",1
This is easy to pair and especially when placing on a tile floor provides whole room sound with amazing bass.,1
They feel stronger then beats by dre. They sound great good bass. The app you can use to adjust the sound and check battery level. It's is a great idea.,1
"Excellent picture quality. Lots of gee-wiz stuff I don't use. Sound quality of the built-in speakers is poor, but I use an external sound system and it sounds great.",1
I really appreciated the ability to transfer the settings from my older Logitec to the new.At first I missed the number keys (on the screen not buttons) but find the on screen favorite station icons so much better.I cant imagine having multiple devices with multiple remotes changing inputs etc. This is a must item.,1
Should have bought Hub with remote. Need more explanation on site to explain how to use install with hub.,1
"This remote did all that I asked of it. Was able to run all my devices in one remote. Touch screen made it easy to set all devices as needed for desired operation. Programming was easy with laptop. But after a week of use and simplification of my home theater system, I came to realize that on a daily basis my cable remote would suffice and could not rationalize spending that kind of money on something that I would use its potential only occasionally.",1
Holds everything I needed with room to spare. Great backpack.,1
I've never had a bad experience with Alpine. These sound great. I would buy these again. Put these in my last truck (doors).,1
Bought new unit after my original sling box died. First one I bought had an issue completing the setup (not uncommon looking on the web). The second box had no issues and works fine.,1
Better all around headphones than beats. Sound quality is far superior than bose and beats. I have had both pair.,1
"Love how to connects to most of my home products, Lutron light switches, Philips hue, nest products, and insteon products. Just wish it were easier to control a single device when that device didn't receive the IR signal it should have.",1
I got a Surface Pro 3 bundle with a keyboard and pen. I purchased both the Surface Pro 4 keyboard and the new pen with the 4 tips. The keyboard with the fingerprint reader is very convenient and the touch and feel of the keys are superior to the bundled keyboard.,1
"This system has great sound quality. When I originally purchased it, I expected it to be average at best because of how inexpensive it is. However, my assumption was wrong. Best $135 I have ever spent on speakers.",1
For the two hour the unit worked.... I found the button layout difficult to use and the touch screen slow and clunky.After two hour the unit locked-up and needed to be defaulted and re-configured.Sending it back not worth the money.,1
Great for starters. Very affordable and easy to use!,1
These videocassettes have proven to work very well over the years.,1
"Love the size, shape, and usefulness of this backpack. Used it to carry my camera and supplies onboard the plane with me. I then used it to carry my camera and binoculars on day sightseeing trips. I love the sturdiness of the bag and the fact that the zipper is not exposed when wearing. Much better than using a standard backpack.",1
"Works well, no to difficult to set-up, didn't give it 5 stars because it's a bit pricey",1
Nice remote. Battery life is not as long as I would like. Sometimes a little fussy but still nice.,1
"My two sons love this so much. My oldest bought this with his birthday money (11 yrs old) and now he wears them all day everyday which leaves his hands free and no iPod or tablet tied to earbuds causing accidents while he does his chores around the house. He started using google voice from his tablet and can talk on the ""virtual"" phone with these headphones. It's pretty amazing. My 2nd son, decided that these we so cool that he also used his birthday money to buy himself a set in blue. It's just a matter of time before all three have a pair!",1
I really like the shape and it works really well when I play games.,1
"Their Software does not run on Apple OSX 10.9 (or even 10.10) - had to return it, since I could not program it.",1
Still learning what it can do ... sound is great ... it was a gift,1
Very easy to install nice look great sound quality,1
"Really a magical experience for music, movies, and games. The sound gives you a spacious soundstage with great separation of instruments and sounds. The bass is rich deep and to me not muddy in the least bit. These aren't beats style bass meaning not muddy over exaggerated geared toward mainly the rap/hip hop genres. These are geared toward everything else. Their build quality is stunningly durable. Comes with 2 wires. One with mic for ios devices. Not sure if the controls for volume and music works for android. Being able to replace the wire if need be and ear pads are too. Ear pads are very comfortable. Clamping pressure on the head is snug not uncomfortable in any way. Of course this will vary so try them if you can. Great grade of sheep skin leather with a great smell to them. The case soft leather. It is unique but not the most protective but good enough. They do not fold flat but to the side for storage keep that in mind. If you want a headphone that will last you many years if not for life consider these. They may be expensive but think of it like this you can get many standard headphones with moderate success at a decent experience but lack durability to take any form of traveling or you can buy one phenomenal pair of headphones audiophile grade and love them for many years to come.",1
"Microsoft has the gimmick that says the Surface can replace your laptop. It was 90% there on the Surface Pro 3, the major downside for me being the keyboard. It was a good keyboard, and a great option when it first released. Then after constant use, it worked fine, but never felt like a real keyboard.Finally, the latest keyboard, released with the SP4, and works with the SP3, feels fantastic and functions perfectly! It's much sturdier, mouse pad is larger and more sensitive, keys are spaced apart better and feel better, and finally a fingerprint login option (only on black keyboard as of now). Overall, this keyboard is great! We'll see how I feel when SP5's keyboard comes around. :)",1
"Since when did people start looking green Maybe, I just have a lemon. However, no matter how much I adjust the tint people's faces look a tinge green, and it's unevenly distributed. For example, the upper right side of a face can look natural while the bottom left looks green, and vice versa, or there are patches of green around one eye, one cheek, and around the mouth and half the side of a chin, and sometimes there's half a green nose. It's just annoying.The sound is ok, sometimes it sounds distorted. I wish it had surround sound.I would have liked the Guide button on the remote instead of having to press the home button on the remote and then pressing the arrow button on the remote to scroll and search for the guide.I like the Smart Hub's white interface. Smart Hub is fast, and I like how the apps display where I've been. For example, when I scroll on the Netflix app it displays the movie I had watched plus movies I might be interested in, and it does it without having to go directly into the app.",1
"The Good- Great song choices.- Nice collection of Old and New Songs- My favorite Coffe House / Blend / Jazz-- Easy setup for Favorite Channel- Simple to navigate with remote.- I connect it with my Onkyo AVR Receiver, so sound quality gets bumped up.- Great for Stereo listening.The Bad-- Music quality will depend on your Speakers.- Will need a mini amp for quality bump up.- Signal may be an issue if you dont have a open space , given signal cable is small.- Low signal impacts Sound Quality.",1
Amazing picture and slick looking tv. Lightweight and just the right size. Price was a steal too!,1
Love this keyboard and fingerprint scanner is a must have! Easy to type and my Surface Pro looks great just like having a paper notebook.,1
"I love this battery charger. I have 2 other chargers and they are just fine but they do not beat this one. This one charges my Galaxy Note 3 fast. It is thin and easy to stash in a pocket or wallet. I can also use the phone while it's attached without having a charger hanging from the bottom of phone. This one I just put on back of phone while I talk and it is just the same as holding the phone to talk. No one is even aware it's there. So It is the best I have found.Pros are its flat and lays behind phone while I talk. Charges my large (phablet) phone fast and completely. It is thin and light enough to go in my pocket, wallet or purse without any bulk. I would not only recommend but I'd buy one for a gift.",1
"If you are an iPhone user this unit works just like the phone. Only cons at there aren't many apps that are CarPlay compatable, and without your phone it's really just a radio. A little pricey for its capability.",1
I purchased the Everest Elite 700 took it home then I started noticing the problems immediately.1st. fit test caused a loud squeal from left earcup speaker into my earthat's cheap noise cancellation headphone problem all the other expensive bluetooth headphones do not do that why does your's do this JBL?2nd. I wanted to fold it when I used the headphone after the portability test opened to use again experienced loud crackling from the left earcup until I powered off the headphones.3rd. JBL Phone APP doesn't keep connected to headphone even with BT connection active could not test functionality of JBL app because of the app disconnecting.4th The Everest Elite 700 doesn't like living loud either wanted to try full volume on phone & headphone volume thru bluetooth connection it didn't like that starting withaudible popping at random intervals during music playback.Even B3ats Stud1o wireless does much better than these at almost the same pricetag.Even the the Turtle Beach El1te 800 & 800x do better with more functionality.Bad show JBL.,1
"Love the material and how it can be detached whenever I want, especially when I want to appear to have a tablet. Fingerprint logs me in instantly. On a few occasions, the fingerprint is unresponsive but it does not happen often. Great product.",1
"Easy to setup, controls everything but my Amazon Fire.",1
If high tech stone age way of changing channels appeals to you this is your way to go. I think the up or down button is going to wear out before i end of deep sixing the thing. Did not realize you could not go to a numbered channel directly. You must scroll.,1
I had a 1100 remote the battery went and was unable to buy another battery for that remote they discontinued that model..In I purchased the new Ultimate One. It's a oustanding remote so easy to set up bright screen and easy to use...,1
"This speaker sounds wonderful especially if your one for a deep bass sound. It also has stereo fm mode on it as well. Beats out a lot of speakers for the size. I'm actually going to order one for my dad, he loved the sound.",1
The speakers sound great in my vehicle. They were easy to install and I love listening to them.,1
This TV performs very well. The picture quality is excellent and the ease of operation is good. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good 2nd set.,1
"IF YOU WANT THE neighbors to come a knocking at your door, then buy these loud and beautiful sony speakers.",1
Identical to my original Lenovo charger at a competitive price.,1
The headphones are better than I expected. I would recommend them to anyone,1
"These speakers fit behind the factory grilles in my car where others don't. The height from the mounting surface to the front of the speaker / tweeter is only 3/8 per the diagram on the box - other speakers can be much taller. Now installed, they sound very fine in the rear deck and, for a 6.5 speaker, the bass is more than what I expected. I've attached the dimension diagram from the box (not found in the manual).",1
"So-so sound, but more importantly, the speaker emitted a high-pitch squeak when it wasn't plugged in to power. Returned to store.",1
This is a good deal and I will buy another one cause I need it,1
"I replaced a model I lost that was 2 years old. The new one looses connection will using it moving in a vehicle, never had that problem with old unit",1
This is my first set of JBL earphones and I have not been disappointed. They produce beautiful sound with a perfect amount of base. They are comfortable when I wear them to watch movies at night. I wasn't sure I would like the white color but I wanted something different than traditional black. I am glad I got the white. They are very well made and I expect to be using them for a long time.,1
This is a fantastic speaker. Great build quality and the sound is awesome. Great battery life. The lights built into it are an awesome added bonus. Highly recommended!,1
This was a realistic alternative to $180 headphones my 10 year old son wanted. The quality and durability are excellent. I would buy them again.,1
"Garbage. I want to give this one star, but technically it works so Ill try to be fair. But this is a huge let down. If you have a multi-step operation, you need to hold it out like the statue of liberty while all the steps happen to maintain line of sight to all the things its controlling. Sometimes it seems to 'misfire' and then i need to turn everything off and try powering it on again. If you switch between activities, it doesnt 'clean up' the last activity, so it doesnt always work. The touchscreen is fiddly and the UI is unintuitive. You need to always hit the home button above the touch screen, which is stupid. You can get lost in menus and not know how to get out. The form factor is actually hard to hold AND press buttons. This is one of my least favorite remotes I have ever used. Check out the Companion model - somehow made by the same company and 100x better: Logitech Harmony Companion All in One Remote Control for Smart Home and Entertainment Devices, works with Alexa",1
Decent set of cheap speakers Not great but you get what you pay for. Better than a cheap off brand from a big box store.,1
Nice to have a spare power supply or replace a missing one.,1
I purchased this as an upgrade to the Harmony One that I had. Over time the Harmony Ones keys were starting to stick (common fate when you have kids even older ones like mine). This was a great upgrade. This remote charges vertically which reduces the amount of space it needs on my couch side table. Plus we can add all our favorite channels and the remote shows the channel logos right on the screen.Setting it up was a breeze. Supply the model numbers of the devices and it all works as I wanted the very first time.,1
"Love having our TV mounted on the wall and like the flexibility that this product gives. We can pull it out a bit, tilt it up or down and side to side. It works perfectly!",1
If you don't use CDs any more this product is good,1
"Just Opened My System Very Satisfied With it,Small And Very Powerful! Simple Hook Up,Clear Crispy Sound And The Sub Is So Powerful With That Ground Shaking Bass! I'm Very Impressed,Seriouly! I Recommend My Brother,He's Ordering 1 Tomorrow!",1
It charges my phone pretty quick. I like the size of the charger.,1
My phone always is charged. I would recommend this to a friend.,1
Product works as advertised. I originally used my iPhone/iPad to stream content to Apple TV to large screen TV. I quickly move to Fire TV which has Sling TV app to avoid the stream. Works great!,1
I have bought quite a few pairs of head phone and have never found a more perfect pair. The sound quality is amazing. The ambient noise detection is a fun feature to mess with. I had to have all my friends try them out because I loved them so much. You feel totally emersed in the music.,1
"I bought this remote based on a sale price, and I wanted to reduce the remotes cluttering my desk. It was easy to program but I am still learning how to use itMy cable provider was not provided in the Program List so I had to add my favorite channels manually and upload the icons myself . As a surprise bonus I was able to load a fun Icon. The Icon I chose for CNN is ""CNN FAKE News"" That alone was worth the price of the Remote",1
This is a great back for hiking around. It is also great for extras.,1
This is do simple to use my 80 year old parents can figure it out..,1
I'm so happy with it I want to gat another one to pair it with,1
Very strong and works well and looks great in our room.,1
4 cores and 16gb ram. a godsend for someone who has been using dual core laptops with 4gb ram,1
"Super fast, just seems a little too bulky. If your not using the cradle and plugging straight into the side of your laptop it puts stress on your USB ports as well as covers an addition usb slot you could be using.",1
Its better than my other harmony remote which had wore out buttons but I should have done a hands on before purchasing,1
"Great sounding small speakers for Home Theater and music. I wanted small speakers for our great room. Room size is large and the surround sound experience is terrific. Room placement is key to maximize the sound. HIghs are crisp, Mids are spot on, and Bass is very enjoyable too. The bass woofer box is really not a sub, rather than the speaker that adds the bass to the system. Although Bose is expensive i am very satisfied with the sound. I give a thumbs up. .",1
"This was a gift for my husband. I did a lot of research before pulling the trigger on this model. It does the job wonderfully. It's easy to program from the computer - plugin the cable, download the software, and start programming with just few inputs and clicks. We programmed our TV, DVD player, Rocky, cable box, and receiver in about fifteen minutes.",1
"Had to slightly charge before using, but it works great. I can change it, my phone and stream music from my phone at the same time",1
Got these for my boyfriend and we both love them. Noise cancellation is great. Happy with purchase.,1
This is the best Surface keyboard yet! Even better than any other tablet or 2-In-1 keyboard I've seen or tried. The keys feel great! You don't even realize it's a detachable system it's so natural feeling. Everything feels just right! Smooth track pad with a nice touch. It's just great! Nice color too.,1
"Bought these Alpine speakers on sale for $39. Excellent sounding speakers, only wished they were a bit more shallow so they could fit under my compact car seat. Otherwise the sound is very well balance between the bass and treble.",1
This addition of ram doubled the speed of my laptop,1
"So far it is in the box, but I am optimistic by the appearance it will be great.Sometimes the brilliant colors of the box and the catchy phrases say it all.When we do finally get it open and begin playing, I'm sure that all of the family will be very impressed and the marketing genius's will have earned their pay.",1
Have used these othen with all mySony camcorder.recordings. I have had no problems with quality of DVDs .,1
"Sounds great in the jeep with top off, good sound but not much bass",1
"Battery life is great, comfortable too, doesn't absorb scents",1
I always liked this remote!! This is my second one as my dog chewed on the first one!!,1
My family doesn't like to use complicated remotes with a lot of buttons.Also you can easily select your favorite TV channels that appear as icons on the color remote screen....we use this feature way more than expected.,1
The two speakers was a great addition to our Sony television and sound bar with subwoofer.,1
"Depending on what you want from it, this may or may not be more useful to you than it is for me. It streams live TV very well, and very clearly if you have a good WiFi connection. But I travel a lot and bought it to watch DVR recordings while in my hotel room. If I want to watch live TV I can just turn on the one in my room. Trying to watch recorded shows is very frustrating because of the extreme lag when using the fast-forward or rewind functions connected to my DVR at home. Also, if someone is watching TV at home, you are fighting over the same DVR/TV.",1
"Programmed it myself, didn't work. Had Geek Squad out twice ... still doesn't work. A waste of $250.",1
PRODUCT DIDN'T WORK AS DIRECTED AT FIRST BUT AFTER A CALL TO CUSTOMER SERVICE A TECHNICIAN WAS ABLE TO GUIDE ME THROUGH THE SETUP!! NOTE !!! YOUR WI-FI SHOULD BE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE OR YOU GET BUFFERING THAT IMPEDES THE PRODUCTS EFFECTIVENESS!!!!,1
garbage remote.bought it and returned an hour later.not worth a penny of the $250.do not waste your money.harmony 650 or 700 does the same for a fraction of the price.,1
"I've owned five Harmony remotes before this one. Before now, the setup has always been a no-brainer. I just finished the setup for this remote and it took me almost three hours. After all those hours I'm still completely dissatisfied.For starters, I had a very annoying problem with the initial setup. I could set up all of the devices and the activities, but then it would take forever to sync. It would hang at about 20-30 and never get past that point. I searched through many Logitech forums and found some suggestions that seemed to kind of help, but never quite got to 100. I even tried a different PC, which was strange because instead of using the same web-based installer it made me install the MyHarmony app on my other PC (same versions of Windows 7...no idea why it wouldn't use the same installer). Sitting at that different PC I finally got the idea to swap out a different USB cable. It turned out that the cheap stock USB cable had a bad micro USB connector. My AmazonBasics USB cable worked though.After that I was able to sync reliably every time. Then I had to make quite a few more changes and sync and re-sync.Now that it's completely set up, there's still one annoyance I can't resolve. Every time I launch the Watch TV activity (the main activity that I want to use this remote for) it changes the input on my TV. Then I have to manually change the input on the TV back to the right HDMI input. If this is an intelligent remote, it should know that the last activity was Watch TV and that there's no reason to change the input. I have no clue why it tries to change the input every time, and every time it picks the wrong one.If I switch from Watch TV to Watch Movie, it will operate my DVD player correctly, but again it picks some random (and wrong!) input on the TV. It's very frustrating.Aside from these frustrations, I don't like the form factor or the layout on this Harmony remote as much as I liked my previous Harmony remotes. The LCD screen gets very dirty. It defaults to a weird home page that I don't like.I'm very frustrated. It feels like their Harmony product line has gone the wrong direction over the years. I hope they can correct their course, because I'm a long time fan of these remotes.",1
"looks good but has some issues over price,will not work with Bluetooth device's also they made it way to complicated to program device's",1
"Overall remote is pretty modern and fancy. However, for the price, I really dislike where the pause/play/fast forward buttons are located. First, they are at the very top of the remote which makes for an uncomfortable grip if you DVR shows and like to fast forward through commercials. Secondly, the pause/play/fast forward buttons are not prominent enough and I find myself pushing the button immediately below it instead. I would have much preferred these particular buttons were more elevated and located at the bottom of the remote. Otherwise, great features!!",1
Admittedly I haven't tried very hard to fix the problem but I only get the touch pad to work every 5th try or so. Makes it almost as slow as typing a password. I do want to reiterate that I have not yet tried to research the issue though.,1
Could not get the very feature I purchase the keyboard cover to work on a Surface Pro 3.,1
"It does what it supposed to do, but too many steps involved. It isn't intuitive, I find myself needing to look at it instead of feeling for controls.",1
Love the sound missed the connectivity. I wish I could walk into the room and tell her to turn on turn off etc. so kind of bummed when it comes to the sound love it,1
"I never write reviews, but I felt I had to for this remote. I was the owner of a Logitech Harmony One for several years prior to purchasing this remote. I loved the One, it was reliable, easy to use, and felt nice in the hand. I have been using the Ultimate One for well a year now, and for the price this remote falls short.First was the set up. Logitech switched to a new program, so if you were coming over from a previous device you had to start from scratch. I feel that everything should have simply imported to the new program. This added a good amount of time to the set up. The remote itself looks great, and is lightweight. However, it does not feel as ergonomic as the One did. It is also lacking the number buttons, which makes quickly switching between several channels more time consuming than a traditional remote. You have to either scroll through the channels or go through the touch screen to find the channel icon you want.When it comes to functionality the remote really falls short. I purchased the 100 hub to control my PS3. The remote constantly loses its pairing with the system. I am them forced to get the PS3 controller and re-register the blu tooth device all over again. It defeats the entire purpose of the remote. It is also not uncommon for the remote and HUB itself to lose their pairing. Forcing you to either restart the HUB or connect the remote to a computer and reset it.The remote also has not had the ability to connect to a PS4 until recently, and it still can not turn the system on/off. If I still need to go to the system or use my PS remote, what is the use of the universal remote The remote also seems to incorrectly perform the start up or shut down of a process more frequently than my One did. Making me either press the help button, go into the devices and fix it myself, or physically get up and turn a component on of off.I would have given my One five stars to give you an idea of the step back this remote is. For the 350 I paid when it was new (including the HUB), this is a real let down.***Update 4/29/16***Somehow this remote has become even less functional. As noted above there is no easy way to change the channel with this remote. The icons are now completely useless. For example if I want to change to channel 44.1 I press the icon button because I do not want to scroll through 20 channels, and the on screen numbers do not work well. The first press will get me 4.1. Next 1, then 4.1, then .1, then 44. Finally I'm at a channel that I can just scroll to. Sometimes it never even gets close and I will just scroll through all the channels. I make sure to keep the remote pointed directly at the TV, and give it time between button presses but nothing works. I am changing my review to one star.",1
"I loved that the Harmony allowed me to setup activities that would make it easy to make sure the right device was on and the right sound/video sources were selected. Most of the time it worked seamlessly and it was easy to go in and change or update settings. What I did not like about the Harmony was the antiquated computer application (for as much money as Logitech has made they can afford to do a much better job), I dreaded the finish on the back of the remotes -- it feels literally like nails on a chalkboard and my Harmony' all emit a high-pitched squealing noise when the displays are turned on. It's not loud per say, but the fact that it's so high-pitched it is very noticeable and annoying considering the proximity you'd have to have the remote from your body to use it (and it's there anytime the display is on). It's also worth noting that the battery life on these is terrible (in most cases it can't go more than two days off the charging base). For the ease of setup, use and functionality, I'd recommend it to someone looking to simplify their home theater setup and get rid of the 3-4+ remotes the average person has. For myself, I would probably not purchase this model again.",1
"Not happy at all with this remote. I had the previous model, the Harmony One, and I loved it. Bought one for my sister and my parents as gifts and programmed theirs in addition to mine. Old version was easy to program and use. I mistakenly thought this would be even better. Here is what I do not like about it (and if this is something I programmed incorrectly and someone knows how to fix it, feel free to advise)1. As I said I programmed all the others, so I don't think I am too bad at it, but I have not been able to get this one to work consistently yet. I am always having to use the help button because the TV wont turn on/off.2. Way slower to do all the steps.3. Help button is not right out in the open like it was previously.4. I have not yet been able to figure out how to make the home screen for my roku come up without having to hit the home button. I get a blank screen.5. It does not tell me when the battery is getting low (the old version did).6. Can't figure out how to make the keypad my default home page for TV instead of favorites channels.7. Pretty much every time I update it I have to reset it, it stops halfway through the update.There are things I like better though,1. A fix it myself option2. the DVR button brings up my DVR listing, I don't know if that was true before or not.Sure wish they would bring back the old model, I'd buy it in a minute. I can't see my parents using this one easily so I hope theirs does not break anytime soon.",1
Not being able to use a universal remote (X1 digital remote) to control the TV kinda sucks,1
"I installed this on my '09 Harley Street Glide. This is my second Sony marine radio, the first lasted about 3 years. This newer model is easier for me to use because the buttons are larger. It's not easy pushing tiny buttons while riding with gloves. I also have a module that allows me to control some functions using the bike's hand grip controls, and I have a Sirius/XM unit attached. It sounds decent and looks good, especially at night with the blue lights. The reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is that on occasion, the volume changes on it's own. It will randomly raise all the way up to 50 (full volume), other times it will drop down very low. I can't figure out why it happens, but at least it doesn't happen all of the time, so I'm learning to live with it for now.",1
"The product didn't hold the charge for as long as I would have liked. The outlets didn't work, only the USB port. Wasn't satisfied at all.",1
"Worst customer service of any Tech company on the market. I bought this Logitech remote about a year ago and it worked fine for about a year, after that one day is displayed an error message saying that it cannot connect to hub and wouldn't work anymore. I called customer service and tried to troubleshoot the issue after being on a phone for over an hour the tech support representative told me that there is a hardware issue with the remote and i would need to replace it. Assuming that Logitech would stand behind their product i proceeded to give the tech support representative my information to send me a replacement remote. however he informed me that I would have to buy a new remote and they would not be able to warranty my current one. just one year ago i spent over 300 on this remote so that I could do it again a year later NO THANK YOU!I would never buy Logitech again and if you are smart you shouldn't do it either.P.s I spoke to the customer service manager, Marvin, who was extremely unhelpful and wouldn't care for Logitech or its customers.",1
"I'm so disappointed in this Samsung TV. I just got it today and set it up only to find out the Smart Hub where all the apps are accessed does not work. I called Samsung customer service about the issue and I was told by a representative that this particular model is faulty where users try to access the Smart Hub and nothing happens. The rep then proceeded to tell me that it is a known issue and their engineers are working on fixing it. So I asked how long the issue was known and the rep said for a week. He told me I can either return the TV to Amazon for a refund or wait until the engineers come up with a solution. So I asked him, why Amazon did not pull this particular model from their inventory and he said he could not comment on that. So I have concluded that either Amazon knew about the issue and still sold the product as advertised even though the smart features are missing (this is considered false advertising and illegal) or they didn't know and the fault lies with Samsung soley. On top of all of that The rep could not give me a time frame for when the issue would be fixed and there is a real possibility it can't be fixed. So now I have this basic tv that does none of the things I purchased it for. Lets just say I'm livid. Please people, save yourself the time, money, and frustration and do not buy this model!!",1
"I bought this to replace my old 10 year old Slingbox. This product is inferior. When watching via mobile, the signal will give out and go black after several minutes and not come back unless I close and restart the program. When watching at home using a laptop on the same network, the signal won't disappear completely... it will just go to a black screen every several minutes, but then continue streaming after a few seconds. Super annoying and I didn't have any of these issues with the old Slingbox. Plus there are ads on this Slingbox so I have to watch the ads again every time I restart because their signal is so poor.",1
"I purchased this speaker as a Christmas gift for my fianc. If you are looking for a small speaker to use, it meets that criteria. The speaker is reasonably priced. There is no pouch or carrying case that comes with the speaker. The speaker produces a nice sound. It is not an ""high-end"" Bluetooth speaker, but it delivers a welcomed punch. The challenge with this speaker is that it may not connect with all devices, at least this is what I experienced. I had a couple of MP3 players that it did not connect with. My fiances phone (Samsung Note 5) would pair, but would drop frequently. I did get it to pair with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A tablet. So, there may be some pairing issues with some devices. However, if you are able to get it to pair, you will enjoy the sound. I will keep the speaker since it works with my tablet, but, I will search for another one that pairs more easily with various devices. If you decide to buy, just be mindful that it may or may not pair or pair smoothly with your device or devices",1
"Purchased this in hopes that someone could set it up for me to record and watch NCAA Football games overseas when I travel. I did so despite reservations that Sling no longer provides support, updates, etc. Three competent people worked with me on it (a guy who installs cable for a major cable company, an IT prof for a large office, and a guy who works does audio/visual for a production studio). We couldn't get it to work - the slingbox could not recognize a cable box from Time Warner and multiple calls to Sling's support did not solve the problem.I used to use sling for several years and even used the hopper by dish with good success. Looks like they have fallen off in their support with all the competition. It is a shame because it is a great item for expats and people who travel internationally frequently - probably just to small a market share.",1
We had this remote and bought another one . The TV turns off for no reason and we can not use our fire stick or Apple TV. The Geek Squad is not a good set up team. By the remote and hire someone else to program. We will have our old technician set it up!,1
Worst piece of high tech gadgetry. Did not work. No HDMI interface. I have 150mbs connection and my network uses latest technology interface. And yet constant pixelation and dropped connections. Don't bother with this. Virtually no tech support either. Simply said....it's terrible. I'd give it zero stars but the review module doesn't give me that option.,1
Tapes work fine. Although quality OK in SP mode. EP mode you get 90 minutes instead of 60 but quality suffers a bit. All in all not bad for price.,1
The headphones are pretty comfortable. The Bose ones are more comfortable. I am not sure the headphones are worth the $$$.,1
I like having the fingerprint sensor version of the Microsoft Type Cover and use it regularly with success. I prefer it over the facial recognition of Windows Hello.The material and color always seem to look dirty however. I guess the black shows all dust and dirt.The keyboard is really good for people who can type though I don't like the touchpad at all. It seems small and I never feel like I can effectively scroll or accurately click something the first time I try.,1
"I saw it, I bought it. I tried it, I returned it. It just doesnt work. I cant understand why Logitech cant get it right with these remotes. I gave it one star because thats the least amount one can give.",1
"Has issues with button delays - as in it takes 1 second every time you press the button. Annoying as ALL other remotes are normal.Logitech tech support has NOT been good.NO amount of tweaking parameters and settings helped. Firmware updates are a long, arduous process with antiquated Java software.FIX IT!",1
I do not like that you have to have an amazon account to download Apps,1
"Dont spend your money on these the sound quality is not as good as the cheap OEMs ,The speakers sound very poor no bass and I had the polarity correct used the little Metra speaker harness they worked great.",1
"not very user friendly. Gets ""hung up"" frequently when trying to turn on or change channels so you have to reset the TV and audio. User manual is only available online.",1
This TV DOES NOT have the SAME BASE as Pictured in the Photo. It has a SPLIT LEG BASE not a solid wide base. The Model Number on the Amazon Page is the SAME Model Number on the TV I received but the TV STAND is NOT the same. BEWARE if you need it to fit properly in a certain spot you need to know that there is a 23 SPACE BETWEEN the LEGS. I had to put the legs on BLOCKS to get it to fit.,1
BT audio on devices was very spotty. Gave up and returned them.,1
It is expensive and sensitive and can be slow and if you touch it in the wrong place it can get you lostAny thing effects it if it is dropped or passed to someone and touched it can mess up mute and it is slow,1
Start with the fact that I have 4 logitech 900 rf remotes plus this one. I definately prefer the old style with more actual buttons plus the real number pad. This unit works as it is supposed to but I need to keep switching LCD screens to do thing that are right there on the 900. The hard number key pad in my opinion is so important that it looses two start without it.,1
Nice mid price range speaker. Not disappointed at all.,1
"not for me didn't like the sound to poor and the prices is to high,you can jugg or do some weight lifting they gonna fall from your head.",1
I bought it with expectation but found it was too tight for big ears and also not so comfortable. the sound quality is fine.,1
"The Logitech Harmony Ultimate One works pretty well, with 2 exceptions. First, It frequently drops the correct HDMI cable setting when I switch directly from cable TV (HDMI 1) input to Roku (HDMI 2) input for streaming video input (Netflix or Amazon). It's easily fixable, but it's still a pain. Also, I miss a number key pad instead of using the video keypad input which often doesn't work. With that in mind, this thing is still better than using 2 or 3 remotes.",1
"5 hours later.....would not recognize a visio soundbar or the Visio company for that matter. Software is a nightmare. Horrible for user friendly. Taking it back to store. Logitech is a great company, but seriously bombed on this remote. DO NOT BUY this remote. It will test your patience and ruin your day",1
"These headphones have great sound. But when on with no music being played it shuts itself off. This is bad when looking at Facebook or looking for music on Youtube. If it takes you more than 10 minutes to come to the next video you have to take them off and turn them back on. Since the rated battery life claims to be 15 hours this ""feature"" is unnecessary and unwanted.",1
"This unit is just OK. I installed it into the fairing of my motorcycle, and within the first 200 miles, it started exhibiting strange behavior that worsened. It appears that the connection between the removable face plate and the base unit. It totally died within about 400 miles. Amazon support was ridiculously awesome, however. I called at 10pm on a Saturday night and they had a replacement unit at my door at 4pm on Sunday. So far my experience with the new one has been pretty good, with the exception of one time that the volume just suddenly dropped from 35 to about 4, and another time that I looked at it and the display was back in demo mode. I suspect that I will have to make use of the 3 year replacement warranty that I purchased before it's all said and done, but we'll see.",1
"it works well but audio quality not really good. Convenient but audio quality not that great, but what can you expect from Bluetooth headphones.",1
"Thought they would project more sound considering they were $300 a piece and I bought 2 to go with the sound bar. Sirius music and some 4k movies project better but not too impressed for the price. They sounded awesome in the store, and it took a lot of convincing to get wifey to agree to buy them. Disappointed for the price most of the time.",1
"We bought this hoping to get the best of both worlds of Amazon echo and Bluetooth speaker. It does great at the latter but only ok at the former.Setup was super easy but had to be done thru an app. I don't believe there was any other way to set it up. As a speaker it sounds incredible. We used it at a Birthday party in a medium to large space and it easily filled the room. Things got a little tinny when we tried to see how loud it would go but in good news it went really loud. Where this speaker fails is as an Echo replacement. There is no way to leave it plugged in to use as a constant Alexa option. The charging port is on the bottom, under a weather proof flap and the cord isn't flexible enough to allow you to flip it back over and stand up regular. It's really meant to be a portable speaker at which it does excel. But then the other issue with using it as a portable speaker for Alexa is that it auto powers off after 15 minutes of no activity or use. So unless you're paying music constantly or asking Alexa to tell you the weather or stock prices every 14.5 minutes, you have to power the thing on to ask Alexa something. Far less than ideal.So it's because of the latter issue with Alexa being barely functional we'll be returning it and buying an actual Echo.",1
"Don't buy it! Save yourself the hours of aggravation. The remote seizes control of your home theater system and it is nearly impossible to make your stereo to work without the remote. The touch screen is amazingly difficult to control. When you try to scroll through the screen you accidentally turn on your dvd player instead of turning on your stereo. Moreover, the display inexplicably changes from one day to the next. Last night, I spent hours and hours trying to get my I pod to play music on my brand new stereo. I failed repeatedly. Are you a fan of software updates Get ready, this device constantly sends itself needless software updates. It's as though this device was designed to frustrate the user instead of enhancing the home theater experience. Wow, how I wish that I never bought this remote.",1
"I bought this for our ski trip to Tahoe. Device works, but can be spotty. Also, you can't change the password so it can be a hassle to always navigate through to the wifi password menu.",1
"In theory, it's nice... the touch screen is nice, the channel listing is nice, it feels solid in your hand.But... Inconsistent results. TV and stereo are often left in unexpected states (on when the remote thinks they're off, or off when the remote thinks they're on). And there's no simple process to correct - a series of simple steps, yes, but you have to know what you're doing. Also, the rounded bottom means that you can't press buttons unless you're holding the device... it just rocks too much to press buttons while it's sitting on a table.",1
"This has gone too far. A remote without a numerical pad is less than useless. Sent it back and downgraded to the 650 (as replacement for my broken Harmony One). Would have preferred a new Harmony One, but the 650 will do.",1
"I bought this for the wi-fi feature, hoping to connect it to my Airplay network. Looks like it doesn't have an airplay option, only songpal, which is a little bit iffy. Would love to get it to work as an airplay device. Anyone know how?",1
"Unlike all the good reviews I read before purchasing this, my experience has been quite the opposite & I am very, very disappointed. I think it took about 3 or 4 hours to fully charge the battery pack when I first got it, & it would then charge my Galaxy 4 phone in about 2 hours or so, but then the battery pack is done. After charging my phone fully, the battery pack drains quite fast when not in use. I started to recharge my phone tonight & although it charged at first, I noticed my phone suddenly began losing the charge. I figured that the battery pack had drained while in the drawer, so I plugged it in to charge it, & after 1 hour, the battery pack still had a red light on, felt quite hot, & the charger at the point where it is plugged into the wall, was so hot it alarmed me, something that had never happened when charging my phone. I immediately removed it, with the red light on the battery pack still on, & decided to see if I could see just where things stood. I plugged my phone into it & saw a temporary green light. Then nothing. My phone is charging slowly but who knows what will happen next. Some are saying they've gone on day long adventures, away from local plug in availability, & had no problem losing power to their devices. I'm in my own home & can only get 1 charge on 1 occasion, & a burning hot charger on another occasion. This device is absolutely serving no purpose whatsoever, as I can charge my phone on the charger that it came with. If this thing won't hold it's own charge, unused, for more than a couple hours, what's the point? Totally useless in an emergency. What a waste of money. And it's too late to return it. So I'm stuck with a piece of junk & am out $43. It was on sale for $40....now the sale price is down to $30. Piece of junk.....maybe just a lemon, but this is very discouraging & I have to say don't bother. Also, be sure to test repeatedly, on different levels of service, from the very beginning so you can return if it isn't going to last. I've got my eye on another one, more expensive but hopefully better quality. Just waiting for it to go on sale. Next time, I'm not going to go with blind trust....I'll test it every which was but loose starting immediately, & return it if it doesn't live up. This product is a dud.",1
"had to take it back, would not work with my T V nothing else to say",1
"I had an earlier version of this model. Two things about it were too big of a hassle.1. It was very easy to accidentally have duplicate buttons on the screen for the same device. I think I spent more time with it plugged into the computer than I spent actually using it.2. You know how you can eventually learn where the buttons on a remote are, and you don't have to look at it? You just kind of feel for the buttons? You can't do that with this thing because the buttons on the screen keep changing position.Also, while the battery is charging, you have to use the old remotes anyway.",1
Worked ok but it gave me conectivity issues. Not worth the price.,1
"Sorely disappointed. Constantly sends two clicks when you've only clicked once - to any device. This remote refuses to manage my Cisco DVR (supplied by TimeWarner) completely - you have to open the DVR as a device, select the button you want and then it will work - i.e. it wont use the device in a macro. Also, only Power Toggle works, Power On or Power Off does not. WAY WAY WAY too easy to click the touch screen when you're laying the remote down, necessitating picking it up again correcting what changed when you put it down.",1
I have 100M and 300M from 2 different locations and Sling Box could only receive a handful of stations. I thought this would be a cord cutter but it just didnt work as I thought it would. Even when I tried it in my house it would connect then disconnect. I have Appple TV and other devices that I have absolutely no problems with. NONE. I have Spectrum and coverage in my home is excellent no problems.This may work for others but it was completely useless for my needs. I returned it.,1
Really loved the Harmony One and wish I still had it. This one has the controls different from any previous model and is going to take a lot of getting used to.,1
Does not swivel............not anywhere as good as the night owl camera,1
"I've been using the same Logitech Harmony One for the last 5 or 6 years now, and it's great (despite the bloated battery issue). Last year when I read the Harmony One was to be discontinued, I bought another One, just in case my current one dies. I'm glad I did, because now the Harmony One is selling for twice the price I paid last year, if you can find one.While the Harmony One wasn't exactly simple to program, it's a lot easier that the Ultimate. I wouldn't say the Ultimate is difficult to figure out, but it's not as intuitive as the One (and the One isn't very intuitive!). For someone going from a One to the Ultimate, you'll certainly be frustrated and disappointed. You may grow to love it, but you'll always long for the One.",1
Good average upgrade from stock speakers,1
It is a good quality product but the menu is a little bit slow and sometimes if you are to far of the receiver the command doesn't arrive to the receiver. Also the config upgrade is to slow.,1
"Bought these to complete a surround system with with the Sony sound bar for my new television. The speakers kept shutting off which was bad enough but each time they shut off they also had to be re-paired with the soundbar. Tried following the technical advice of the Sony rep at the store but everything recommended did not work, so back to the store they went. Anybody have any suggestions for a replacement?",1
"Bought at Best Buy, device will not connect using Bluetooth. I have tried two Galaxy S5's, an iPhone 6, and my laptop. Followed the instructions online since the included instructions are worthless. At best the device only shows up for a couple seconds to pair and always fails, but it takes several tries to get it to show up as a option. Tried using NFC to pair and it fails every time as well. Worked over WiFi without problems, but the Bluetooth seems dead.",1
I bought this as a replacement for the old Harmony One because the touchscreen got crunched. I pretty much hated it. I went out and bought another old one (for about 100 more) because it is so much better (the old version) I definitely don't recommend this remote. I do recommend the older (discontinued) Harmony One. I gave it two satrs because it does function as a universal remote. Maybe it works for other people.,1
"Easy to install and easy to use. Looks good, reads music off of a USB drive as advertised, and bluetooth setup to my phone was a snap. FM reception is fine, and RDS works great, and the price is fair. Be aware that the remote that comes with it is a small handheld IR thing, not RF, and needs to have line of sight to the faceplate to work. It won't work If your radio is mounted below deck or in a box.I liked this product enough in the first week to try and buy the RM-X11M wired accessory remote that is called out in the manual, since the IR remote won't work for me from the helm. Unfortunately, Sony has discontinued the RM-X11M remote, and it is no longer available for purchase! Sony support says that they no longer produce ANY wired remote that works with this head unit, and I've not managed to find any 3rd party remote that will work.So.. its a nice unit as long as you don't buy it expecting to use the wired remote that the documentation claims is available. I'm very disappointed that Sony would discontinue the remote for a radio that they produced less than a year ago!",1
"My friends and I jokingly call my TV the Not so Smart TV as this more accurately describes the product. After turning the TV on, expect at least a 3-minute wait before using any of the TV applications. Additionally, do not expect to receive any help from customer support. I spent an hour and a half on the phone with Samsung. We reset my TV two different ways, the problem persists, and they have done nothing to improve my experience.My advice: Buy any other TV. OR, if you're getting this TV, get a fire stick or Apple TV to have a more seamless experience. I wouldn't have bought this monitor for half the price.",1
Good luck guys. Once you spend an hour firing up this bad boy and finally get your device to connect and start to play music you won't be able to stop it without physically shutting off the speaker.,1
"Got a 65 on it. Installation was a breeze. Only complaint is the TV of this size means your studs better be situated so the TV is centered on the mount. There's not enough strength in the bars to allow you to move it right or left without the TV getting off center as it tilts right or left. I was able to make mine work but will be upgrading to a heavier and more expensive version for my den. In hindsight, I should have paid a little more for a heavier duty version. Not a product issue, but me trying to shave a few bucks.",1
"Dog ate my Harmony One Advanced remote - it was a great remote!This one, the Ultimate One IR Remote, is not nearly as stable or useful as the original. The touch screen is touchy and cranky. It is VERY sensitive to the angle and pressure you use to activate functions frequently selecting channels you didn't... No matter how many times I program it - it continues to confuse the BD (BlueRay) and TV/SAT (Dish) selections - requiring either the Help button or a manual input to make the desired selection. It is slower in executing commands than the original (I hope Logitech Management reads this). However, it works (mostly) and is better than a side table full of disparate remotes.EDIT: 22 September 2014 - Still have to keep a couple of the old device-specific remotes handy. For example the Ultimate One does not mirror all controls of my Panasonic BD Player...once in a while I have to use the original remote for accessing all the settings or functions. Battery life is a joke - a couple of days off the charger and it dies. The more I use the Ultimate One the more I dislike the nameless engineer who designed this mediocre excuse for a Universal remote. I have downgraded the original 3-Stars to a more appropriate 2-Stars.EDIT: 12 December 2014 - DO NOT BUY THIS FRUSTRATING, POORLY DESIGNED GARBAGE! Thinking maybe a firmware update could help with this device's erratic stability problems I went to the Logitech site. This piece of junk is no longer even mentioned or carried on the site. The Ultimate One form-factor is non-existant. Poof! Gone away! When a manufacturer will not acknowledge one of their products then you should RUN away from purchasing it. Dropped to 1-Star rating.",1

You can't just leave it on the end table or other surface and reach over and push a button on it because the bottom is rounded. Another design flub is that the transport keys are located above the touch screen ! If you want to push play, rewind, pause etc., and you brush your hand across the touch screen before it times out you'll change the channel, or something else. Very irritating!!The good: It's very easy to program, and the charging cradle it a winner !",1
Works ok but it does not have number buttons. No number buttons might seam like a small issue but you cannot go directly to a channel without taking several steps to bring up the numbers on the touch screen. Try changing channels with out staring at the screen. That does not work!,1
good sound but.... will not stay on my ears or headuseless if will not stay on my headalso gave it to a friend to see if it was just me but he had the same problems with the headset,1
very poor quality,1
"I had my old Logitech Harmony remote 9.5 years. The buttons (non touch screen) started to give out. I bought this new model recently. I still have my same thoughts from last time. Doesn't seem like they care about ergonomics at all. The most commonly used buttons are at the bottom making them hard to use. It is even harder to use the pure touch screen buttons (as opposed to a touch screen for instructions while hitting an actual button out to the side of it). To only be able to page up/down with the pure touch screen is almost impossible. To touch the correct choice while holding the remote out in front of you is quite the feat. To only be able to hit numbers on a pure touch screen to key in a specific channel is even harder. Again, it is the ""usability"" not the performance that lacks",1
"I read a review on amazon and I should of taken her advice , stops working ALL the time .too late to return to BB so the mfg. sent a replacement and the same thing , stops working .. now the mfg. will give me a credit for a more expensive set by the same mfg. that's like throwing more $$$$ for a product that well still stop working . and by the way , BB was no help at all with this product .....",1
"Does a great job turning on and off devices. But the touch screen to input individual numbers does not work. Customer service is ineffective and when they say they will escalate the problem to a higher level, they do not call back",1
needs more devices to be more effective. (out of stock everywhere) and not s friendly interface.....,1
"Wow- We've had a harmony remote for years - love it - the buttons were getting challenging to use and I thought - why not get a new remote that has more features.Terrible mistake - this Ultimate One is NOT intuitive to set up - the remote setup features through the website is a fine idea - however the remote activity setup is not simple and not intuitive.The remote has too few buttons - not enough hard buttons means you have to scroll through touchscreens to get to the commands you want and when you are there - the other hard button commands don't work.Eventually I was able to determine how to customize the existing hard buttons to function how I need them to - the issue I have is that this is not a simple process.It simply takes too long to do what you want and the simple, everyday, hard buttons that you need and use all the time are no longer there. It takes a lot of customization to get what you need and want.Certainly challenging - I think over time I will be able to get this programmed the way I want...I hope.",1
"I'm shocked that a manufacturer would ever use a magnet that could damage a computer....but Netgear did. I needed a wireless connection for my desktop computer. With limited space on my desk I placed the unit on top of the computer case. Well, I got it setup but it damaged my hard drive making the computer unless to me at that point. I have used other products by Netgear in the past that was why I trusted it would be a good product. Whoever designed this product does not know the dangers of magnets and computers.",1
A little hard to get used to for those of us over 60!,1
"We found this remote difficult to use because it is so sensitive. It took several tries to enter three digits for a TV station, because it wanted to go to the station represented by the first or second digit. Also, it won't""talk"" to our Bose sound system, so we had to use the Bose remote and this one...so it wasn't very universal. In short, we returned it in frustration.",1
"I used this set a lot, but I got it because it was the best I could afford, and frankly the quality/durability was not durable. Very susceptible to sweat and buttons eventually sank in. Gave it back and traded for another type of headphones.",1
Bass had static and the cord that connects speakers to laptop did not work. Returned to store and replaced with another pair. Second pair works great.,1
Unless you put the remote back in the cradle every day the batteries go dead in 3 days. Must look at remote to do simple things like volume control or change channels. Should be intuitive by feeling the control buttons. The lesser model universal remote is more user friendly.,1
"hard to program, not as many features as my old on, going to take it back when I find the receipt",1
"The charger is such a low wattage that it fails to charge my Lenovo Thinkpad, despite the website saying it supported this type of computer.",1
The remote performs as described. I have two issues though. One is it stops working sometimes and i have use my order one util i can snyc it. Two is the location of tbe buttons they are not in good locations. Buttons that are used the least are in the best location. The more popular ones are in ackward position to use with the remote shape the way it is. These are not problems as much as a nusaice.,1
"Like most people I hate having seven remotes to control my system so combining them into one unit is a great idea. I appreciate the opportunity to review the Ultimate One and compare it to my two-year-old One with the failing buttons. Although the Ultimate One is pretty smart and quite functional in many ways, Logitech misses the mark for me on several important points.Software: Try finding Roku for the Harmony. There are several classifications to look under but none of them make sense for Roku. It's listed under DVD. Go figure. Try Apple TV. Good luck with that one. Brand new hardware (Ultimate One) with the same old crappy software. If they spent a couple of days with a new software team leader in charge, maybe they'd come up with a better system, but this one has irritated me since I bought the old One more than two years ago.Hardware: Improved the shape and size over the old One so that now it stands up in the charging stand, taking up much less room on the table where it sits. Also added a textured back to make it easier to grip. They got rid of the superfluous buttons that cluttered up the old One, but also removed some pretty useful ones. These buttons are now accessed through layers of a touch screen. Sometimes this works out well, and sometimes not. Really depends on your equipment and the type of controlling you need to do. For me, I still keep the original remotes close enough that I can use them to do the more intricate things I don't want to bother setting up and troubleshooting on the Harmony. Yes, troubleshoot. Not everything works right the first time.Some inconveniences: Ever hand your remote to someone so they can control things Well, be careful with the Ultimate. About 1/4 times one of us will accidentally activate something on the touchscreen during transfer from one hand to the other, and we're being careful. Also, for some reason they put the playback buttons (play, FF, REW, etc) above the touchscreen. Try using those without activating something on the touchscreen!Set up: Since I already had a Harmony One that was fine-tuned to my system (which took months to finesse!!!), set up was just a matter of transferring the information from the One to the Ultimate. Easy-cheesy. I don't look forward to learning how to set up the Ultimate for a new piece of equipment after seeing that the software is still the same: lame. For now, the Ultimate controls most things fine with no fuss on my part.If you want to get rid of all of your remotes the Ultimate One could be your solution. For me it wasn't. If you want the convenience of controlling most of the common functions of a lot of equipment and don't mind the limitations, then this expensive remote could be a great addition to your collection. We now have nine remotes instead of the seven that came with the equipment. The old One is still on the charger for my wife's use (she doesn't care for the lack of buttons on the Ultimate). The Ultimate is for me, most of the time. The individual equipment remotes are stashed close-by in case I need to access something I can't find on the Ultimate.If Logitech would update their software to the 21st century (they still have Laserdisc but don't have a proper category for ROKU) and put the touch screen at the top with all of the buttons grouped together, I'd love the Ultimate One. If they don't make changes to the software I won't buy a new One when this One wears out.",1
"Programming via the computer was an arduous and timely process, there was significant lag between clicking and the program registering the input.",1
"Previous version was much better in hardware and software. The problems I have are short battery charge life and it loses control of some features/buttons at different times which require you to turn off the activity and re-select the activity to restore functionality of commands. Firmware updates have not solved the command drop problem and there is nothing you can do about insufficient battery for the electronic issue. Also, and directly related to the battery life issues is the over-reliance on the LCD screen. I prefer a better balance between buttons and LCD screen. Buttons allow less time spent staring at the remote when you do not want to. This may be an overreach thinking that all things are better of with more/most/all of its functionality tied to a screen but a remote is not a phone or tablet/PC and the viewing source of the entertainment, it is meant to be just a control. Having to focus on the screen to command your electronics can be a pain. Mashing together two preferences into one is a cost control option by Logitech and not a consumer focused decision.",1
Bought open box and it was defective. The main speaker had no sound so I returned it for a full refund.I have a similar 2500W Boytone speaker with a different design that works great. Bass can be adjusted with the remote and sounds great. Unfortunately the one I got was defective.,1
"Sound was low, and distorted when sound was turned up. Music didn't project well in a small room.",1
"Much better than my old 2010Jetpack (also from Best Buy) but much heavy n much thicker. Don't like it automatic start the device when plug in for recharge. Verizon charged me for $250 for half day use in Vancouver, Canada after the staff told me only charged $5 per month to add Canadian use.",1
"If you are over 50, and not tech savvy, avoid this device like the plague. It is counter intuitive, poorly laid out with the worst ergonomics of any remote I've ever used. The first week of learning its convoluted system was not relaxing and I still use the help program often.The battery needs recharge daily, and I use the component remotes because the battery is dead-don't put them away.",1
"The sound ,low or high,sounds too good to be TRUEbut it has no Stereo headphone Jacks ! If I had known this, I never would have purchased it.",1
"I got this one because of the great battery life. The sound is average, and the bass boost has to be turned off most of the time. When songs are supposed to have that massive amount, you can turn it on without drowning out the rest of the sound. The flashing lights are neat at first, but I have them off too. Overall, it's decent, but not amazing.",1
This is just a fancy all in one remote sometimes it act up and won't shut a few things off. So I returned it and stuck with my Xfinity X1 remote.,1
I had a Harmony universal remote prior to this one and it was great. This remote is very inconsistent and not user friendly. I've had Geek Squad out four times and they can't seem to fix it. I'm planning on returning or exchanging.,1
"I registered for this for my wedding and I really regret it. Whoever decided to make the number pad touchscreen should be fired. That's the stupidest, most annoying thing in the world. I programmed it so that when I pressed watch TV it turned on the TV, amp, and cable box. 99 of the time it doesn't turn 1 of those 3 on and I have to walk the stupid thing through it. I'd sell it if I didn't have a conscience. What remote doesn't have an 'input' button on it I don't want to go through a little touchscreen. Awful, awful product.",1
"For experienced Harmony Users, its OK, but just barely. If you are a new user I sure it is the beez kneez compared to what ever you used before. If you are looking for a replacement for your Harmony One+, though, LOOK ELSEWHERE. Logitech has completely destroyed the ONE THING that made them far and away the best remotes on the market. We are talking serious competitive advantage here folks.What the heck am I rambling about, you ask Its this: the ACTIVITY BASED PARADIGM. The Ultimate still has activities, sure, but it concept has been crippled beyond recognition. Specifically, on the Harmony One+ you could define 'favorite channels' which would appear on the screen so you didn't have to remember the channel number for every thing - FOR EACH ACTIVITY. If you had two 'Watch TV' activities, you would have two sets of favorites. Example: you might have a 'Watch Cable TV' activity and a 'Watch Free-to-Air' Activity - each with its own channel changing mechanism (Cable box or TV) and each with its own channel numbers of course.The Ultimate does not allow this, there is one set of 50 favorites that you can associate with one 'Watch TV' activity. If you are in some other activity and accidently press one of your favorites, it will terminate your current activity and switch to that 'Watch TV' activity. This is NOT the behaviour we have come to expect from our Harmony remote where the programming hides the complexity and the buttons, all the buttons whether software or hardware, apply properly in the context of the activity we are using.The disastrous effect of this designed functionality transforms the Harmony range from head and shoulders above all the rest of the 'Universal Remote' into an expensive, beautiful, well made but 'Ultimately' flawed run of the mill remote.",1
It was false advertising. Shows Howard and football on box but you can't get on the receiver. Very disappointed,1
"As a replacement for an iPhone 5s as a hotspot, don't know if it's worth the extra phone line, and download speeds are barely acceptable. Not really worth the extra costs.",1
"I used these headphones connected to my PC via a Bluetooth dongle. 95% of the time the sound is great, no issues. The other 5% of the time I had audio issues where I would get what sounded like the Bluetooth dropping out (crackling, scratchy audio) and time distortions where I would lose parts of the what I was listening to or watching and it would slow down or speed up to catch up. When connected to a PC directly via the included cable, sound was great, never any issues. But that isn't what one purchases expensive wireless headphones for.Also, the ear cups didn't seem to give enough room, my ears were often sore, and the band across the top of my head always left the top of my head sore because it wouldn't open any more. (My head is of an average size, in the Goldilocks zone, not too big, and not too small)Brought these back, and upgraded to the Bose Quiet Comfort 35's. Definitely a little more money, but the difference is night and day.",1
They sound fine. The noise cancelling is fine. They get heavy and hurt the top of my head or ears after wearing for a couple of hours - I use these to tune out the open office environment at work - so I can't stand to wear them for a full work day.,1
"Like the remote, but eh touch screen does not always respond, and gaining access to the bottom activity is sometimes difficult. I prefer the old style where you have buttons on the side of screen much better or the large screen of the 1100.",1
"No software update for this, description not clear on age of device.",1
Not a replacement for broadband internet.I purchased this Unlimited data plan 4G 6620L MIFI to use as my Internet provider as I travel across North America in a motorhome. Not a good solution for streaming Amazon fire sticks or uploading Utube videos.Back to the drawing board,1
"overall good.buttons are too small, sound goox",1
"Be aware that there is no service on any Harmony unit after the warranty expires.

"I anticipated limitations with this item. I was right on, gave it a shot.",1
radio is not bluetooth which is not a good thing if you want your kids iphone s to be connected to.,1
This is the worst remote control I've ever owned. You're better off getting up and changing the channels manually then buingy this piece of junk.,1
"I wanted a small unit that had great sound. This was much bigger than I was expecting (my fault for not checking measurements). Sound was great but unit is cheaply made, all plastic. CD player door finicky.",1
"Functions OK and had some promise, but Sony messed it up with their app integration and insistent Demo Mode that comes up. Faceplate bezel also does not want to stay on no matter how it is manipulated.",1
"I had high hopes for the remote. I initially programed basic functions, but I found the process cumbersome (and I consider myself fairly tech savvy). As a result, I found myself using the original remotes when I got frustrated. Basic channeling changing took too many swipes and the touchpad would not always read my gestures.",1
I bought this item thinking that it made sense to be able to sling it over the shoulder. Turned out to be very inconvenient. Replaced it with a conventional Domke bag.,1
they gave me the wrong ram and thank goodness i didnt break my computer.,1
Im not sure Ive ever purchased a piece of electronics that Ive found to be this pathetically bad. It definitely bucks the commonly held belief that more expensive models from the same manufacturer MUST be better. This may work for some but Im an experienced tech owner and I think its junk.I could list all the reasons I hate it but that would mean Im throwing my time away along with my money.If you are looking for a good Logitech universal I BEG you to pass this one by. They make less expensive and vastly better units.,1
I returned this item. I did want a flat screen mount that would allow me to turn the TV but this thing was HUGE and HEAVY. Plus it didn't match up to the back of my tv so I couldn't have mounted it if I had kept it.,1
Easy set up. Sometimes does not turn on the TV immediately. Hit the help button and that turns on the TV.,1
"Do not buy this unit if you plan on standing it on a table with its flimsy, unstable legs. I had it on a table with my cable box. Bumped into the table and the television fell over onto the cable box and damaged the television's screen. Don't know why Samsung went away from the base stands that they use to have.",1
"Not very useful in the real world. I'm online looking for a new remote because this remote is simply too complicated to use easily. The placement of the top set of hard buttons is too hard to use without activating some other function, and the sensitivity and layout of the soft buttons / touch screen is too complicated for other family members... (using with Sony TV, Apple TV and Tivo)",1
Installed in a new Dell XPS tower. Memory speed showed 2133hz when all installed memory was 2400hz and all DDR4 memory. Computer would show proper memory amount but would freeze all the time (take this memory out and it wouldn't freeze). Memory Test showed errors. Replaced with Consair brand - no issues.,1
For me it is a nice remote but touchscreen has been buggy. Button placements a little weird. In all honesty I cannot recommend but it is not the worst remote out there.,1
Salesman said these would work on Ipod. Well he was wrong. They might be great headphones.,1
Not Dell's best effort. The whole thing feels cheap.,1
"Probably a nice television, but not as advertised! Doesn't look like the picture. I contacted Amazon to check about the base, and despite clear assurances, the TV arrived with two little feet and not a central base. Amazon was gracious about the return.",1
"These speakers are decent for the price. 50-60 a pair is pretty inexpensive for speakers. In the past I've run 100/pair Polks and Infinity's. The guys at Best Buy were pushing these, told me they'd have pretty great bass response when paired with my Alpine deck. I installed them front and rear in my vehicle. I didn't really think the bass was too fantastic, though I haven't ever really been satisfied with the bass output of any of my speakers by themselves- I always wind up adding a sub. Honestly, at first listen, I could tell that these Alpines were a little more tinny, and had a little less presence than my past speaker choices, so I was slightly disappointed. But I should have expected that when I chose to pay less. All of that being said though, these speakers are still a big upgrade from stock speakers. I wasn't unhappy with these speakers, I just could tell that they performed slightly weaker than speakers I've owned in the past. I still drove this vehicle with these speakers for two years, pushed the stereo pretty hard, loved the sound on a whole, and never had any problems with them. Really not bad for 52",1
"We bought these for my son and ended up returning them the same day. The volume level is extremely low. When playing music it sounded ""tinny"".",1
"My husband installed it and computer couldn't find it and when he did get to it, the drive kept ejecting on him. Took it back and got and got a 5TB external hard drive. So much better.",1
You must look at the device at all times. It is not designed in a way that your finger tips will recognize the individual keyboard functions.,1
I didn't like this product. Thought it lacked features for how much it was,1
"First let me say I bought my Harmony Ultimate One from Dell, not Amazon. I had been using a harmony remote with fewer functions and really liked it.But I've had so much trouble with this one. This remote has a feature that you press if the remote didn't carry out all the steps you asked it to perform. For instance, if you want to watch roku, the remote is supposed to turn on the television and sound bar and change the television HDMI to the one that Roku is on. I'd say 6 out of 10 times, I've had to ask Harmony to fix it. Eventually, it does fix it, but as often as not, it takes several attempts. About 50 of the time, the off button doesn't work. And finally, there's not much life to the battery.....and that's been true from the get-go. I really wish I hadn't bought this thing!",1
This thing is absolutly worthless doesn't control my new samsung tv or my Xbox one s nor the sound bar probably cause it's brand new this year. I'm very dissaponted I will use it with my other tv and direct Tv but I won't ever by another Logitech remote I got a urc remote now and it works awesome,1
These headphones sounded good but I don't think they were worth the price. I ended up returning them and getting a pair of skullcandy's that were not quite as good but good enough to save $200,1
"I bought this camera and I can't get the talk feature to work. I get an error message something like ""press to talk failed"".",1
this is a good big screen mount that is fairly easy to mount,1
"rams are pretty expensive atm, bad time for building any pc",1
Fine for iPhones but doesnt charge a laptop. No use.,1
"When I was looking at this item, a Best Buy Rep assured me that it would NOT require the TV it was hooked up on to be on the same channel as the remote operator. In other words, if I was accessing it remotely and I wanted to watch a football game then my wife at home would be able to watch something different. I purchased it, set it up and it was the exact opposite of what the Best Buy Rep said. The TV/Cable box that it is hooked to will only display what is being called for by the remote user. I subsequently returned the product. I would recommend doing your own research and not relying on the experience of the Best Buy Reps. In addition, when the store manager in Danbury CT. read my account of what happened, he sent me an email asking for further info. I replied with the info. His solution was just to say sorry. Not acceptable for someone that had to travel an hour to the store, an hour home, an hour setting up the product, an hour traveling back to the store to return it and then an hour home. As an elite plus member I would have expected at least some type of discount coupon for my next purchase. I will not be shopping at Best Buy going forward and would recommend that you buy this and other electronic items elsewhere.",1
The remote is simple to set up and easy to use but only when it wants to work. Half the time it will not power on the devices so once you turn them on individually through the remote it works fine. But its really frustrating that it only works when it wants to. Even had Geek Squad look at it and they couldn't fix it. Going to return and get a new one to see if its just an issue with this remote.,1
"This little speaker has a wonderful deep and clear sound. WOW, how do they do that. It can even be synced with another same speaker for stereo. Here lies the problem. Both speakers must me on the same network and connected to the internet. Setup is nothing short of complete frustration, and the instructions! Well, not the best. But if you can make them work the sound is amazing. Just travel with 1 speaker only.",1
"I like the LCD on this remote. My only complaint is that this remote is too slow. When I press ""Watch TV"" it starts up and is unusable for about 25-30 seconds while starting up. This is an issue if the kids were watching tv at a loud volume level. Then, after they are in bed and I try to watch tv, the volume is very loud and I am not able to adjust it down until the remote is ready. 30 seconds of loud TV once the kids are in bed is like 10 minutes, underwater!The battery life is only 3 days or so, compared to my last harmony remote that lasted 10-14 days.I'm thinking about going back to my old 700 series Harmony,",1
Bought them open box. Haven't set them up as of yet.,1
Forget it if you have RF controls. This is only for IR controls. Overpriced and it tends to lose its settings.,1
"After a few months, my slingbox stopped recognizing my Chromecast v. 2. The cast icon stopped showing in the slingplayer app (for Android) even though it shows and works fine in every other app I have that casts. I opened a ticket in May and was told that it was escalated. I was never contacted, though I was eventually told that the ticket was closed and that they tried to reach me but couldn't. This is impossible since I am on call. Of course, there is no resolution available based on that ticket. A new ticket was opened, and almost a month later, there is still no information. All I get is a runaround including repeatedly telling me that I emailed them that the problem was resolved because I emailed that a different problem with a different ticket was resolved.",1
this device was no good it is for Direct tv and not over the air ready.,1
I had the only for a month and the right ear short circuted,1
"Stay away from this remote! It is almost impossible to change channels! When you select a channel, say 1210, it may put 12 or just 1. You cannot directly enter a channel number on this remote. Lastly, one time it turns devices on an off, then other times it does not. I have had Harmony remotes in the past which were far superior! Maybe it was a defective unit. Suffice to say, I returned to Besr Buy and got a refund.",1
I never got to hear what kind of sound quality it would produce because the stereo deck was bad right out of the box. It was hooked up properly according to the directions/wiring diagram and it wouldn't power up.When I checked it with a multimeter it didn't have continuity through itself internally.,1
"I have hd WD drives in the past with no problems, unfortunately this one was dead on arrival.",1
"The remote is a great idea and Logitech has definitely taken time to make setup as simple as possible, but the touch screen interface isn't very responsive and the programming is a lot of trial and error with manual configuration still needed. Once it works though, it's great!",1
"It fits with the Lenovo I'm using which isn't a Yoga, but it gets really, really hot. Most of the cords do, but this one seems to be worse than others",1
"I love slingboxes however, this is my third or forth unit. They do not handle power spikes after a power outage. I would recommend the geek squad protection it has saved me.",1
"It was terrible and I am very disappointed, especially after having the prior model.I tried to sync it with my computer for over two weeks,and the computer could not find it.Then I tried three other computers with the same result, including a Mac.No success, so I returned it. Amazon sent me another one which I received very quickly and painlessly. I had the same result with the second one--it simply would not sync. I went online looking for an answer, but nothing worked so I returned that one also, and got a refund. Now I am looking for another brand, because Logitech is hopeless. do not buy one, period.",1
"Not a bad charger, but it's a little bulky. Charge holds for a while.",1
"doesnt work with roku, i hate how it turns everything off when you select a new input...sometimes i jsut want it to turn it on..but it has to turn everything else off first....get it fixed",1
It was a nice loud speaker with flashing colors real good bass too,1
I like it so far. I don't like that you can't have a number pad and one touch favorites at the same time.,1
Works but hard to get it to put all systems on have to go back to device settings all the time,1
Always messes up and you have to use help to get everything on or off. Not strong on signal. If you are 15 feet away it starts having problems. Touch screen should have been buttons. When applying enough pressure to change fields it enters what you touch. I am really disappointed. Not worth $50.,1
We plugged them into the system to give a try before installing. They sound good on rock n roll classics but for movies the sound was a little too muddy for me,1
"I've used harmony remotes for probably a decade now, and I was underwhelmed by this model. Basic setup is easy enough, but it doesn't seem to reliably apply the settings to all of my devices. Usually this is a problem with the receiver, it doesn't always go to the right input. Advanced setup is no longer intuitive at all, maybe I was spoiled by the earlier remotes software, but this one is definitely more complex. The battery seems to last about a week of normal use, sometimes less, my earlier remotes would go closer to a month.On the positive side it does seem to be well constructed, and has survived a couple of drops unscathed. The LED is easy to read, and the button placement is pretty intuitive.",1
"A good idea that works well enough, but switches slowly, possesses suspect build quality and ultimately breaks. I'm on my 2nd Harmony remote (two different models) in two and a half years. The latest became a brick after I tried correcting the hour minute readout. I rebooted, only to have the device migrate to 'freeze' mode. Additional reboots yielded the same result. Logitech's on-line help directed me to remove reinstall the battery, which is a real pain in the keester. Same result.Another electronics manufacturer needs to compete in this segment. Logitech is ripe for picking. Unfortunately, I'll probably go to Best Buy again and buy another Harmony. The convenience is too compelling. I just wish . . .",1
"For such an expensive device, the software is pure stupidity. It waste time at start up updating my device when there is nothing to update. I mean, wait until I change something, then update.That said, I have to fall back on my device remotes everyday because this device is little more that an on switch.I wish I had saved my money.",1
We returned this to Amazon as we found the touchscreen to be overly sensitive and also found the remote seemed to have a mind of its own. Channels or activities would change with no one touching the remote. Maybe we have a ghost in the house but we are much happier with our old Harmony One.,1
"I had a Harmony 880 that I loved and used to control TV, sound system with audio inputs and a WDTV media device. Had it programmed for TV viewing, media streaming both from WDTV and Amazon Fire TV Stick, radio, audio input from mp3 player and audio input and monitor from computer. The 880 was great with display screen and physical buttons. After a times thru display was unnecessary just pick the buttons for what I wanted to do. After nearly 5 years the buttons finally wore out and I replaced it with this one. I was able to transfer all my devices and most of my activities from the 880 after finally digging up the password for Harmony device web account. Much of the control was transferred from physical buttons to touch screen which seems a bit tricky to control. I have not had it long enough to see if I can reprogram buttons for activities to regain some the functionality of old remote. Even if it can be programmed to us the buttons seems like it will still require a lot of looking at the remotes screen rather than keeping my eyes on the big screen. But I guess that's progress and soon there won't be buttons or screen just speech and then brain wave scan which will be replaced with a logarithm based on our habits and what we did in the past that was selected by a logarithm. I miss the days were I could just push a button repeatedly until ran across something interesting.",1
I really like this store they have amazing products.,1
"I bought this hoping it would be an upgrade from my much older Harmony Remote that I had for years but is showing age. BIG MISTAKE. This remove has a pitiful display and minimum buttons requiring you to wade thru multiple menus to do simple tasks. It is tedious to use requiring two hands instead of just one with my older unit. So instead of an upgrade, this was a significant down grade.",1
"I had an older version that was expensive. Loved it! This one, well , some of the buttons dont work. My Cox Cable box cannot be used by this remote. I think the thing that really bothers me is that the battery inside the remote is not changeable. It sits on a charging cradle, but you cant replace the battery to the remote like the older one. So I guess at that point you would toss it out? And the Geek Squad said dont leave it in the charging cradle since that will eat up the battery life. Leave it off till the battery gets really really low then put it back on the charger. Well, great, I always leave mine in the cradle when not in use. So I am going to go back and see what other options i have and go from there. Either way some of the buttons do not work - they are supposed to. And for some reason I thought newer model perhaps newer better options. Not the case. Actually less than my other one. Go figure.",1
"I don't suppose Best Buy employees are knowledgeable about every product, but I received no warning about compatibility issues. I have DirecTV, and getting SlingBox M2 up and running has been a huge headache. No luck yet, despite conversations with both SlingBox and DirecTV. Some kind of disclaimer from Best Buy would have been nice.",1
I purchased these new JBL headphone to be able to listen to music at the gym I found out that they are not made for that because you can hear every little noise around you. so I will give them to my nephew and purchase me some beats by Dre because I had them before.,1
"we had the first unit which had the number pad, this unit does not have the number pad, or channel search by ""page"". It does have a ""favorite"" channel reserve, so is just another way of searching, but still like entering the channels by numbers.",1
"the remote will change channels, change devices or change from my dvr when i pickup the controller. the unit is very sensitive. other than that it does everything as advertised sometimes when you don't want to",1
Being electronically challenged has made it difficult to use. Hard to figure out all the options. Makes us as seniors a little nervous. Nice having all devices in one remote,1
"This unit was completely functional. it was just too much of a change from our older model Harmony One. Biggest drawback on this unit, without locking the screen, couldn't pick up the controller without inadvertently hitting a control on the touchscreen. Not an optimal design, IMO. Returned this unit and found a new replacement unit for our older model.",1
"Less than 24 hours after receiving TV, it went out...no picture but sound worked. Called Samsung and after repairman came out, the motherboard has to be replaced!!!! Already!! Unbelievable! How are your products made Samsung Pretty pitiful. Good news is they are repairing it for free. bad news is the wait.",1
Very disappointing. Lists the ability to turn components on. I constantly have to reinstall programing. Family Hates it!,1
"Like the older model better, this model I have to have the doors opened. Screen is very sensitive..wish there was a better alternative.",1
"I received an email from the woman at the front desk: You have a package up here. I dropped what I was doing, ran to the front, grabbed the box, and gt back to my desk as quickly as possible. Channeling my inner Ralphie Parker, I tore open the box, ripped off the plastic and grabbed a hold of the keyboard. Its a crummy commercial: Much like Raphie Parker being told to drink Ovaltine, I questioned why I bought this keyboard. There is nothing special about this keyboard. Sure, it says its made with Alcantara.. and it feels pretty neat - on the outside of the cover (aka the piece that you touch when you carry it). The keyboard itself functions exactly the same, and the inside of the case is the same fabric you would normally have. It has the same chiclet backlit keys, and the same Surface 4 touchpad. It's 30 dollars more to get this slightly silky feeling on the back of the cover. I LOVE the surface tablet, and the keyboards they make for the device are excellent. If you got this keyboard you'd be happy with it, but there's nothing about it that says it's worth the extra money.",1
The bass response is no well at all . You have to keep the radio at low volumes to get a halfway decent bass sound. If you raise the volume past 12 horrible.,1
"I used to have a laptop with a built in wireless network adapter and it was stable. My new computer, at the same position, was not stable and would drop plenty. Online games wee impossible to play. Connection would sometimes drop for minutes at a time. Drivers were an adventure to achieve. Later gave up and bought a long ethernet wire. Expected a lot more from the top of the line network adapter",1
"It doesn't work for everything, Will not recognize my Bose soundbar. I got it to not have to use all my remotes and I still have to use most of them. I can't get to netflix without the TV remote. Also the buttons are really small and slippery so my finger slides off a lot. I would love to send this back but missed the deadline by 4 days!",1
"First I had to wait to have this product shipped to the store near me since that store did not carry them. When I finally got the speakers, they did not work! This item does not include some kind of receiver or remote and if you want to mount the speakers to the wall or hook them up to some stands then you are going to have to purchase special adapters for each speaker that costs about $35-45 for ea speaker! Horrible experience so I returned this product and got some Klipsch speakers instead and now I'm happy!",1
"I purchased this RAM to add to my new Dell computer. The packaging is very misleading, saying that it is 2400 MHz compatible with both 2100 and 2400 DDR4 (my Dell runs at 2400). Installed the new RAM and the computer became unstable very quickly. Was with tech support for a day+, checked everything, reinstalled the operating system, everything... Nearly reboxed the computer when I decided to pull the RAM to see what speed it was actually running at. Dell ran at 2400. Pulled it and installed this in the same slots, it ran at 2100. Once I pulled this and reinstalled the OEM, never had another problem (including after purchasing additional Dell RAM).",1
"Hello all,Please do not waste your money. The product is not great & not much innovative. It is a normal remote & good thing is it has screen. Other than that the product is not user friendly. You should have logitech hub and which costs additonal $$$ ...I am gonna return the product....",1
Not what I wanted to use running & working out. It will not stay on with any movement.,1
"The 6620l has a much better battery life than my old hotspot, but it has original software version 1.3, which I cannot upgrade, according to Verizon tech support. That keeps me from 5 stars.",1
Great build quality and great sound. Top pad is comfortable. Ear pads are a little too small to cover the ear comfortably. And the last thing is they are really tight on the head. Puts lots of pressure on the pads and ears. Can only wear for half hour at most before they hurt.,1
"I purchased this camera so that I can watch my cat when I am away from home on weekend get-a-ways. The camera works with an app, called Hubble for Motorola that can be downloaded from the app store. I am somewhat satisfied with the camera due to its notification settings and ability to detect temperature changes and sounds, but unfortunately if I would have known about the plan that is required to utilize some features after the trial period, I would have gone with a different product.I'll start with some features about the camera that I enjoyed: I really like the fact that you can control the notifications to include things such as a preset temperature change, sound detection, and motion detection. I currently have mine set up to notify me of any movement near the camera, so I receive frequent notifications of any movement on my device. The camera can record a live stream or an action shot that is then stored on the app's cloud to be accessed at your convenience. I also like the fact that there is only a few second delay with the live feed, and the two way communication with the microphone is a really good aspect.Unfortunately, there were only two major things that I didn't like about the camera. After a period of 2-3 weeks, the camera is still a live stream video feed, but the motion triggered recording that I was previously enjoying is now only available by enrolling in a monthly plan. Essentially, now I am only getting notifications that include a photo of the motion that triggered the camera. Since my free trial expired, I am now only receiving pictures of my cat, instead of the recorded video. When I go to upgrade my plan, I discover that 30 days of the product features I was previously enjoying would cost me an additional 29.Read more",1
Hit or miss when turning on/off TV. Not user friendly. No user manual. returned product.,1
"Just don't. Go with something that at least looks sharp if you have money to blow. These Bluetooth headphones don't come with their own USB transceiver and the microphone is designed for a phone only and won't work with a USB adapter and Skype. The sound is actually muffled and has less depth than my $50 Logitech Bluetooth headset. If you do want to plug them in and use the cord, the cord that comes with them wouldn't reach to my pants pocket and it uses a non-standard connector. The first pair I got bricked when I paired it with my PC. In the end, I returned the replacement because it was such a huge disappointment. I was really looking forward to noise canceling headphones but the noise canceling just adds a layer of random white noise to your music that changes in volume based on the ambient noise. It doesn't seem to cancel anything, it just has this annoying hum that changes volume with whatever is going on around you. I was REALLY disappointed with these headphones. They could have at least made them LOOK fancy...",1
"I'm giving this remote three stars because I'm sure it's great, but it didn't suit my needs. I have a Roku box instead of cable and this remote was incompatible, so I had to return it.",1
"I bought these at half price and they sound good, but not great. My Beats solo 3 sound better.",1
a little too tedious to use. still have my separate remotes nearby.,1
They have a good sound quality but they were so tight around my ears that my ears were in pain after an hour of using the headphones .,1
Page up/down button doesn't work. Finger touch screen doesnT work all the time. Manual off Internet is useless. Too difficult to understand. Too complex.,1
The touch control is erratic there should be a warning when the battery is low I would recommend only for the convenience not the operational status,1
"Decidedly meh. Screen refresh time is slow, and animations are slow. Honestly less intuitive button layout usage than the simpler models. Happy with the battery life at least, so there's that. Gets the job done, but I wouldn't recommend it.",1
"The Logitech Harmony Ultimate One remote started out as a great product with easy on line programming. Controls all my devices, even older model equipment such as a CD changer. There are several serious drawbacks. First, the remote is rechargeable and that's great if you have an outlet to plug into at your favorite chair, otherwise, the battery dies without warning. It at least should have a low battery alert that gets your attention. There are times it seems to loose functionality while it still looks active, apparently when losing the charge. Doesn't turn on all the devices, (and won't repeat a command, see below). Secondly, it is awkward to impossible to use with one hand. The touchscreen must be reached across for some controls and can be touched inadvertently. The remote has an odd shape and is not comfortable. Third, if you use the remote to turn something on, it will not repeat the same command without first choosing another command. If for any reason the device changes conditions, such as the input source, from the condition the remote left it in, you must turn it all off, or choose another command before you can reuse the first. You may think it is ""locked up"". Even though the touchscreen can be inadvertently touched causing an unwanted command, choosing by touching is not that easy, especially numbers. It has a vibration feedback that takes some getting used to but you better learn to use it or you will have many missed touch commands. Lastly, it does not play well with a ""DirectvReady"" TV when operated using that feature. Using Logitech instructions, you can get some functionality, but plan on a slow process of training individual buttons to individual commands. Considering the awkwardness of the remote, it soon became not worth the trouble. Logitech's technical support was useless in helping understand or resolve the problems. If you are technically savvy, you can probably do it yourself, but the original remote will be nearby in my experience. Even when trained, the time it takes for the TV to show a picture when choosing to ""Watch TV"" with the ""DirectvReady"" as the input, is painfully slow while the TV searches for a Genie etc.Also, the complexity of a smart tv with all the menu options makes using the remote more trouble than it is worth. So, it's great for having replaced several remotes and simplifying commands such as turning on and controlling a CD changer and surround sound system. But the functionality and usability for a smart TV and ""DirectvReady"" (operates as a Direct TV ""mini"") is a drawback. There simply are not enough named button choices for it to be intuitive to use easily. I can only recommend it for the ability to turn on the right devices for a particular function, such as listen to the radio or watch a DVD. It's too expensive when you can't do it all with ease.",1
It's an ok keyboard the fingerprint ID is nice but it's thin so when your typing fast it feels weird. The only other thing is the outside is suede.,1
Apps that are preinstalled do not work. I called Samsung and they told me it wasnt their fault.,1
"I have 2 pairs of these. They are very comfortable, and for a bluetooth headphone, they sound is incredible. There's just one problem....I have to replace them every 3 months. They have that JBL sound we love, but the electronics are shoddy and JBL doesn't seem to want to fix this. All 3 units have been sent back for just failing out of the blue. They just magically stop turning on and won't charge or anything....and this is usually after 2-6 months. I am a casual user, so they're still brand new when they die. JBL will only honor the warranty for 1 year after the purchase price, even though my second unit is being replaced a second time in 3 months for the same manufacturer defect. So, you'll spend a couple hundred plus tax on a pair of headphones that won't even be burned in when they die, and then you're just expected to purchase another set for the same price that will do the same thing. I keep them in their case. They never get wet or thrown around or abused. They're expensive and I treat them as such....but they still just...stop....working out of the blue. JBL is aware of this issue but doesn't seem to fix it. Keep the receipt and buy the Best Buy plan if you buy these. You'll need both.",1
"In order to work you need component cables, not HDMI. My cable box only has HDMI.",1
"I have a smart phone but I'm still getting used to the touchscreen element for this device. Lots of swiping to get to the correct menu, page up & page down tends to roll up & down on the screen which slows down my surfing!",1
"Reasonable sound, but terrible latency. When connected by Bluetooth the delay is approximately a half second. Even when it's connected via the audio cable there is a delay, though it's not as bad as Bluetooth. I don't have this problem with, for example, a much cheaper Anker MP141 cube speaker (though the sound quality doesn't compare).",1
Signing in to get a hot spot is a pain and then keeping this charged is also inconvenient. I prefer the hotspot on the phone and will be going back to that. The only advantage to this was that it had room for 10 devices.,1
The type cover is not too bad looking... i don't like the the velvet like material and it seems a little bit laggy... overall good but not great.,1
Good bag. Bad bestbuy service. They were unable to privenatch this one with Amazon. Sold by Amazon directly; just because the price variation is too much.,1
The sound is pretty good and it fits just about anywhere.,1
"I bought this as a replacement for an older Logitech Harmony One. It's a step backwards in many respects compared to the Harmony One. It doesn't have a physical keypad which makes using it as a replacement for your cable/DVR remote awkward if you just want to punch in channels. There is a touch keypad screen available, but it is really awkward to use compared to a physical keypad. From an ergonomic perspective this is about as bad as it can get. It is awkwardly balanced and very thin at the end of the device. The FWD and REV buttons are located on the end of the remote and are really not positioned in a logical place. The battery life isn't nearly as good as the Harmony One either as it needs a recharge within about 3-4 days even if it hasn't been used very often within that time frame. The ability to use gestures on the touch screen seems like a unique idea, but in practice it doesn't work smoothly. Overall it's an OK device and fairly well built, but for the money there are a lot of shortcomings.",1
"I bought this to use as a whole house wi-fi connection. I told the representative at the store exactly what my intentions were and he said it would work fine. After 2 units I realized that this is really only for a close range ""hotspot"". It would've been nice if the rep. Had been able to advise me better. The whole process took 4 weeks & a lot of work & frustration on my part. It may work fine if you stay within 10 feet but otherwise not so good.",1
I used the feature to copy settings from a prior device and the new controller did not work properly.,1
"Spend more to get something better than these,",1
"The layout of the controls seems a bit awkward. The fast forward, play, rewind controls seem difficult to find and use when only using one hand to operate the remote. I often hit the wrong key (e.g. pause instead of play record instead of rewind)",1
"This is the most user hostile product I have ever purchased, EVER! Just when you sit down to watch your favorite show, the remote stops working you have to sync the remote or install yet another firmware update. Sometimes this requires you to connect the remote to your computer which must be in the same room as the hub. This takes several minutes. After the updates, you will have to go through rearrange all your screens the way you had them before which is a pain in the butt when all you wanted to do was sit down to relax watch some TV.After only 18 months, our remote would only show the Harmony logo would not go any further. When I called Logitech's customer support, they walked me through some troubleshooting then told me that I would need to buy a new remote. Not over my dead body!!!If you like waste your money you like lots of stress, than this is the product for you!",1
"It's not often that I write a REALLY negative review of a product but in this case I'm going to make an exception. I have been through 3 Harmony Ultimate One remotes since May of '17. In every case the device itself was defective. I've been on the phone with Harmony's support group for over five hours total trying to figure out why the devices continuously either do not work on start up period or works for less than a month consecutively. The download of software refused to communicate with the device, the ability to transfer functions from one device that was set up correctly was impossible due to software issues and over the last two days I have returned TWO devices that both were defective. Look, I liked the intuitive way that the remote worked and was trying to find a remote that my wife could operate without a degree in computer language and serious complexity issues. Harmony's support folks were very nice and were very willing to send me a replacement (three times!) but at some point it's important to call it a day and look for a remote that's simple, operates multiple devices and doesn't result in wanting to kick the dog and drink heavily.",1
"bought these headphones hoping they would be comparable to the Bose. they are not. connection is a pain and once connected, audio issues make listening less than enjoyable. sound quality is irrelevant, the cracking/skipping makes me want to take them off immediately. very disappointed i wasted my time on these",1
"So far this new remote is taking some getting used to. Navigating the menus is not very intuitive. I initially programmed only a few favorite TV channels, only to learn later that those would be the only channels I could go directly to. I still have to use an old remote to get to other channels quickly. Once there, this remote works OK. Also I don't particularly like the layout of the buttons on this remote. It's apparently not designed for single-handed use. All of the most used buttons are near the bottom of the unit and it takes two hands just to mute or change volume settings. I will be programming more channels when I have time.",1
"The sound from this new model is not as the older version that's now discontinued. Does not have that deep bass or sound. Works great however and was awesome at the pool having not to worry about water splashing on it, still not as loud as the older model which is the gray and green model. However I had to return it and search for the older model online. Totally satisfied! Buttons are sturdy and unit is well made to last! I use this at work and sounds great!",1
Work only for 2-3 days and after that i am trying to connect and it is not detectable .................. and facing lot of issue while connecting them,1
Won't rate as a good surround speakers for the TV.,1
"The help button has been moved to a sub-menu that requires two or three clicks to access. Also, the page up/down button was removed and is now shared with the channel up/down button, which causes me to change channels inadvertently when scrolling through menus on my cable box.",1
I have not been able to get transferred correctly.,1
I really like the blue color. It has some good options for the EQ and the display. It did not come with what I needed for the F/M radio to work. I've had it for 3-4 months and some of the buttons sometimes do not respond sometimes. I like it when it works correctly.,1
I felt the sound quality was poor.,1
"Not sure what happened to the Harmony Remotes. I had the Harmony One Remote and it was the best remote I ever had. This remote was DOA. I charged it to 100. Loaded the software. When I tried to sync the remote, it wasn't recognized. I did everything that other users have done via the community site. Different computers with different Operating Systems, different USB ports. Nothing. Still would not sync. Returning it back to Amazon.",1
"This is a train wreck. I loved the 880 (and gave many as gifts). I really loved the One. This thing is terrible. Bad ergonomics, bad button placement, and WAY TOO MUCH TOUCHSCREEN with not enough physical buttons. After 6 months, I'm giving up and putting it in a drawer. I've found myself using the Harmony to turn everything on/off and the Comcast remote for everything else. That's how bad this is.",1
I think this product works good when you have basic devices to control. I had a Samsung sound bar that it would not control. Not helpful as you don't know this until you buy it and try to program it.,1
"I found this Bose System to be slightly better than my older Yamaha system. It lacks the clarity and depth I would have expected from Bose. The subwolfer cosmetic design is bad - the speaker wires and power cord are on the underside of the unit. Makes it difficult to install. Additionally, there is no power indicator or on off.",1
"I have a bose sound system and so far, I have been unable to get the remote to work with this system. For some reason, it does not want to work with it.",1
I have been a long time fan of the Harmony remotes..I cannot even remember how many different models I had purchased over the years.. I was ecstatic when the harmony smart control came out. I loved the idea with an iPhone app for more complex functions and a simple non-screen remote for the day to day usage.After a while though I found myself using the iphone app more and more.. This lead to keeping phone charged. Unlocking it to get to app. Launching app. So I thought an Ultimate remote added on to my hub would be great.It was not!The migration was easy enough but right off the bat the Ultimate would not turn my TV on and Off.. It would not control my appletv AT all. Said I had to setup the remote as a bluetooth keyboard. Did not have to do that with the other ONE remote. Even after setup it worked periodically and the bluetooth would pair and unpair and pair and unpair.The bugs and glitches took me back to the first Gen Harmony. I gave up after 2 hours.Expensive is not always better. Do yourself a favor Get the smart control with the simple remote and the iPhone apphttp://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Harmony-Control-Smartphone-Simple/dp/B00BQ5RYI4/refsr12ieUTF8qid1405979126sr8-2keywordsharmony+remoteit is much simpler and cheaper yet still gives you the iphone app so you can do more in depth changes if needed.,1
"Sigh, I have an old Harmony that had some buttons which were no longer working, so I decided to by the newer model. To make a long story short, the cloud based system that they use has been revamped. It should have been a simple process to log into my old account and copy my settings from the old remote to the new one. Instead I had to create a new account and copy settings from the old account. This took me a couple of tries (my fault) and because I couldn't delete an existing remote from the system I actually had to create two new accounts to get everything set up right. Not to mention the new system is based on silverlight and crashed on my Mac the first time I tried to set up the remote.As to the remote itself, it works just like my older one. The only difference appears to be the battery life, which is much shorter than my old one. They mention that you should put the remote in the charger when you're not using it. I can see why.",1
"Bought the Logitech Harmony Ultimate One about four months ago. Worked great until last Friday when the screen went all white so I checked the Internet and got the suggestion to reboot the unit by holding down the OFF/MENU buttons for 15 seconds. This shut the unit down and that was it. Can't restart it so it's now a paperweight. Also, forget about any help from Logitech, that's nonexistent. Live and learn, will NEVER buy anything from Logitech again.",1
"This remote has never worked right. I have started over setting it up 3 times and it always ends up not working correctly after a few weeks. It never changes the devices to the correct settings. I have to use the Fix it Myself option EVERY time I make a switch to a new mode or turn on my devices. It is not worth the money or frustration. I have defaulted back to using 3 different remotes, much easier.",1
"I bought this to go with my harmony smart hub since it's often dark in the bedroom and the basic remote doesn't cut it especially for my wife. However, I'm the only one who uses it, it has more satisfying feel in hand and vibration feedback on screen button hits, but needs a partner hub to do IR/Bluetooth/RF combined. And the layout of the buttons is far worse than the ""free"" basic remote they throw in with the hub. Also only the screen is backlit so I still need to memorize key positions. This often just stays on the charger. The hubs were 5 star purchases this was a small help, but for the price should really do more, as it's more than the hub and simple remote combined.",1
"I upgraded from a Harmony 650 which I liked a lot. I bought this so I could control both my upstairs and downstairs entertainment centers. The touch screen works well and you can use the touch screen for some commands... (pause,play, FF, etc) Easy to do the INITIAL programming with the Harmony software. ISSUES= a charge only lasts two days. good news, it only takes about an hour to recharge. I loaded my favorites on the remote and was looking forward to being able to choose from the remote instead of pulling up the Dish Network Menu and scrolling.... Unfortunately, you can only use the favorites on the first ""watch TV"" setting. If you try to use them on the second ""Watch TV"" setup, it turns off half of the equipment instead.",1
"Easy to set up. Disappointed that there is no external speaker port. I use weather info for ""music on hold"" feature of phone system. Also, not sure how effective the battery back up is. Radio acted as if dead when unplugged w new batteries installed. If these features are not needed, it would be great.",1
was looking for a new portable speaker and this was recommended by the store's sales associate. The sound is very good but I have experienced issues with charging the speaker and would prefer if there was a designated on/off switch witch it does not have.,1
"TV & Pic is as expected - unfortunately the samsung ""universal remote: will not send signal to my Verizon FIOS cable box to change channels. Samsung tech support could not assist. Geek Squad will only help if I pay for an in home session. Can't believe that a ""smart TV"" comes with a controller that can't talk to the cable box. Very likely bringing this one back to the store for a refund.",1
"I bought this for my elderly mother, who has trouble working the remote that came from the cable company.She never uses it.I've found that she can't get the hang of swip/touch controls be it on this or a tablet. She gets it messed up, and then gets frustrated.I am pretty tech savvy, and even I find it easy to accidentally get on screens I don't want to be on. The icons on the screen are also to small and don't always show up well.I actually liked the screen set up on the 1100 model better, but they don't make that anymore. It had it's problems too.I like the button set up on this model better, but I wouldn't buy either one again.",1
"I bought this mount for my 70"" sharp aquos and it does not support the weight when extending it away from the wall. It tilts to one side or the other if it is not perfectly centered, and not by just a little.",1
"Using this remote to control anthing you will see a very noticeable delay, fast-forwarding through commercials is terrible. The touchscreen makes navigation terrible, constantly forcing you to look back at the remote. It must be charged much more often than you would need to change a regular remotes batteries.Please do not buy this product.",1
To start off sound is super objective to the individual listening so I'm not saying I'm a sound aficionado just going to tell you how it sounds to me. First thing that you need to talk about with this unit is the unboxing experience. The manufacturer made it a fun experience with a quality feeling EVERYTHING! Once you get past that you see all its features and I was excited. I booted mine while it was on it's wireless charger to find my first pro and con. Alexa is great if you have amazon music which to be fair Logitech gives you a trail of it to get you started. I don't listen to my music from Amazon and didn't like that I was forced into because my music service was not supported. Asking basic things like paus stop or next track are fun but I noticed that when I used the Alexa side it disconnected the Bluetooth side... every... single... time. So I stopped using it for that and just focused on sound quality. Unfortunately this was a tall order on this unit. I felt the sound had a incredible amount of treble which hurt me even at 50% volume. My phone luckily supports a great equalizer built in and I tweaked it to sound good but not great. For how much you invest in a unit like this I felt like they fell short. It has a lot of things to love like the basic waterproofing it offers and wireless charging to make everything super simple but to me those are cool/gimmicky. To summarize if water proof speaker is what your looking for with wireless charging then I would say this is probably the best one. If your looking for the best sound you can get I would say maybe something else.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope it helped a little in your decision. Good Luck!,1
I am not a big fan of Sony products. But this has a decent sound. Good for a medium sized room. Quality is very clear not muffled. Extra bass feature lowers the sound significantly.,1
Its a little glitchy at times,1
It ok. It's very important for my school work and my family,1
I owned the Logitech Harmony one and it was very nice and easy to use The ergonomics are awful on the new Harmony your choice of functions are on the screen all the time but if your finger touches usually when setting it down,1
"This Motorola Pet Scout66 Wi-Fi HD Pet Monitoring Camera gives you a good deal for your money right now with everything being free. To begin with the nicely compact Video Camera will give you a pretty good picture similar to HD with it's 720p screen. The camera also has digital zoom, infrared night vision which provided a pretty good picture in a completely black room and even gives you room temperature display and alerts.The two way communication provides ample sound. It's nice when you can both hear what is going on in a room as well as speak to whoever is in the room. Motorola is calling this a pet video camera, but in actuality, this would make a great security camera as well. Can you imagine pointing this inside your door, seeing a burglar and speaking to them I'm sure when you inform them that the police are on the way, they won't hang around too long.To use this Wi-Fi video camera, all you need is a Smartphone or Tablet, and if you want to be able to view also on your PC, you will need at least Windows 7 or Mac OS 10.7, along with Chrome 24, Internet Explorer 9, Safari 6 or Java 7. I have Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 9 and can view everything perfectly. There is a Quick Set Up that literally anyone can do in a couple of minutes. You simply plug the camera in, get your Smartphone or Tablet and download the Hubble for Motorola Monitors App from either the App Store for iOS devices or from the Google Play Store for Android devices. Run the Hubble for the App on your Smartphone or Tablet, follow the instructions to create your account, then log in and you are ready to access your live camera stream.The set up is really a breeze, but should you have any problems, there is a really thorough User's Guide, and if you need more help, there is an 888 number for a live customer service rep to help you. I had a problem with the camera connection, and found the easy fix in the User's Guide. My LED on the camera was slow blinking, but when the guide said to move it closer to the router, it worked perfectly.The important thing I have to tell anyone setting up your App account for this camera is to read everything during set up. I found out while reading that while there is now FREE motion and detection and Alert and FREE In-App Video Recording, it will not always be free in the future. I read that the still photos from the camera will always be free, but the videos will not. Also, as with all things from the internet floating free in space that can be stolen, the photos and videos streaming out there are encrypted for security and can only be accessed through your password, so they are as safe as they can be. But, it seems as though it wouldn't be a bad idea to turn off your camera when you are home though for your own privacy.All in all this is a nicely priced Wi-Fi Video camera with a good picture and sound, and with everything being pretty secure with it's encrypted pictures and your password protection, it's giving you a good deal, but I would love to know when the FREE motion detection and alert and FREE video recording will change to NOT FREE, what will it cost me then This is a good 4 Star Camera, as my still photos will always be free, but if I should want the video of a burglar robbing my home, how much will that cost me Until I know the future costs of the video recordings, this camera is only 3 Stars.",1
It's an amazing speaker but only lasted 4 weeks before it broke. Can't return it since it's past the 15 day return policy. Terrible product.,1
"This was my third Harmony Remote. My last one was an 880. I simply wore the other two out (wishing the buttons were a little more robust). I am a big fan of Harmony. I had great expectations of this one but it has let me down. The feel is good, the layout looks good but it is unbalanced and the touch screen just simply sucks. It is a very poor quality touch screen. I don't need to go on and on about it. Luckily, I bought this from Costco and I was able to return it easily. I am looking to buy the 700 online even though it is no longer being made by Logitech.",1
"The software to configure the remote works great, it's an improvement over the old app I used with my previous Harmony One.The battery life is too short compared to the Harmony One. I have to put it back in the charger about every third day.The transport controls are located at the very top and require a second hand to operate.",1
The price for this speaker encouraged me to buy but the sound was actually worse than the laptops little tinny speakers.,1
"I want to love this remote, but I just can't. We got this for a great price and I debated on keeping it or not and finally decided to keep it. It is OK, but not near as good as the Harmony One in my opinion. The touch screen is a great idea, but really easy to hit things that you do not want to because it is right in the middle of the remote. I think it would have made more sense to put it at the top and have all the fixed buttons at the bottom like the Harmony One and then you would not have to reach over the touch screen to get to some frequently used buttons and accidentally hit the touchscreen. The layout of the buttons also does not seem as intuitive as older harmony remotes in my opinion and maybe that is more because I am used to the older layouts. Maybe if you are new to Harmony with this remote it would not be as big of a deal or noticeable for you.I also do not like that the bottom of the remote is curved so that it will rock from side to side with only a slight touch or movement when on a table or TV tray. I think it only hit the deck once so far and it did not cause any damage, but it is a significant concern (with hard floors) when you have a remote this expensive. All the other Harmony remotes that i have had did not have this issue (One, 880, 670). It may be of no concern if you have plush carpeted floors.I did like that the newer harmony software would automatically have all the channels available to pick favorites and it puts the icon for network on the touch screen. This was pretty slick and in older remotes there was no easy way to do this.I also do like that the charger puts the remote vertical and takes up a much smaller footprint. It is also much easier to see if the remote is in the charge from across the room. The thing i do not like, is I feel the battery life is much lower than either the Harmony One or the 880 (both discontinued). I have to charge it much more often.",1
"I bought this product with the understanding that it did more than my phone already did, well it does not it. First off the apps that are available are very limited, Pandora being the main one. There is iHeart radio, and a couple others but, most of us use pandora. Second a big screen and you can not watch any media content, there is a park brake switch, and safety features, so why not? This radio serves no other purpose than acting as a phone and half the time you can't hear the person or they can't hear you if you have the AC/heat on or any window down. You can't talk to text or ask Siri anything for the same reason. I would rather have my factory system, and my 800 I spent on everything. This head unit/ display panel offers nothing but a credit card payment or a lighter wallet. Save your money do something fun, like a weekend at the beach.",1
"It has great sound quality, with very good base response. Comfortable to wear. Problem is the left ear no longer gives any sound, or barely audible. Want to return.",1
Purchased these once for the sole purpose of being able to use bluetooth for media audio. One side didn't work. I ended up upgrading to the Beats bluetooth model.,1
Got this to replace older Harmony One which I loved. I hate the all touch screen as it is hard to find the one you want and easy to accidentally touch a function you do not want. I finally bought a Harmony 665 which works much like the old Harmony One.,1
Not sure the remote is a necessary purchase or worth the money.,1
"Bought this headphone for my vacation. First problem, after taking it out of the box, it was very hard to setup. Second, It was too big and heavy to carry around, not very portable.",1
Really nice and useful but very tiring to configure. I returned it back.,1
Should have read the other reviews more closely. Wanted to be able to cast throughout my house. However the picture quality of the casting was not HD. Really can tell the difference watching sports. Decided to rewire part of the house instead. Might be OK for streaming remotely - but did not hit the mark for what I needed.,1
Disappointed to say the least played with this in the store liked the fact you chain multiple together but no matter what I tried could not reset use another streaming device thought might be my phone used another still nothing returning hesitant to buy another. Bummer,1
"Good sound that will fill a small room. Not as bass heavy as Bose Soundlink, sound a little distorted at max volume. Great features when using Songpal app, allows for connection to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. I have occasional issues trying to reconnect to the speaker from a computer or phone via Bluetooth.",1
Sames like my stock speakers and when volume goes to a certain point that's not even loud it distorts and can't hear what the words are,1
"This type cover gets quite dirty and is tricky to clean. Otherwise, it functions as expected and doesn't look horrible, although I'm disappointed that it no longer has the crisp, clean grey color I was attracted to in the first place.",1
Volume button is too loose and changes volume when riding motorcycle!!,1
"This product is a perfect example of BAD Ergonomic Design.For some reason, Harmony redesigned the interface from its Harmony One remote and its very awkward and un-balanced in the hand when using it.Just some of the issues Ive experienced: Touch screen must be swiped in a motion that is different from your phone, so it is awkward and must be done many times to get it right. There are no numbers to change channels and its impossible to find them on the touchscreen. When you want to pause a program, or rewind it, the controls are out of reach of your thumb and then the unit is un-balanced in the hand. You end up having to use both hands. The Guide button, which is used by all the cable and satellite companies to navigate the channels, is way out of comfortable range.So, I get wanting to make the product NEW and different from its previous models, but there is an old adage, If its aint broke, dont fix it.The original Harmony One was really a perfect remote and I implore Harmony to go back to that model, because the new designs are really BAD.",1
Sometimes I am frustrated because my phone and kindle have lost contact sonce the last time they were used.,1
So I dix buy this for the mother-in-law while she watched the house she is very untech savy ..Every single day I've had to re sync and reprogram it. Needless to say my mom in law didn't watch tv that weekend.This particular product blows!!!!!,1
difficult to use,1
Cumbersome,1
The battery failed completely after only a few months. Logitech customer service is awful! What a waste of 200.,1
"Cannot hit play, FF or Rev, etc, without having your hand/arm over the touch pad which is VERY sensitive! The slightest brush can mess up what you are watching. I have to brace my forearm on the bottom part, keep my wrist bent up very high in order to use the playing options. Even then it's not a given it won't sense your arm over the top and change it to a different channel or activity. Also no way to use a number pad that I can find so have to grab another remote to do that. It's a nice idea but very flawed design. It would be much better to have the touch screen at the top at least, and a screen to go to that gives the number/alphabet option.",1
"Absolute GARBAGE. I had the previous Sony unit that I purchased from West Marine. When the blue tooth went out I took it back under warranty and this was supposed to be the upgrade. Sound settings are all presets and there is no way to customize Trebil, Miss and Lows. I don't like being forced to listen to their presets. My stereo now sounds flat and Low. No where near the high sound quality should I should be getting. I am running 8 Marine 6x9 and a RockFos 10 inch Sub on a JL audio 8 channel Marine Amp. Not happy at all!!",1
I purchased this after Thanksgiving; I am disappointed because almost all of my electronics are Samsung. The display dims and darkens and I can't control it. It's really annoying. I will be returning this. I've only had this TV a couple of weeks and if it's already doing this; it will only get worst. I don't think I should get a brand new item repaired so quickly after purchasing it.,1
failed to operate devices as claimed,1
Touch screen failed 2 months after very light use. I followed all troubleshooting tips and reset to factory settings twice. The Harmony remotes are usually rock solid - but this one died well before its time.,1
"Sounds flat, can't get treble in quality.Also too complicated just to use.",1
We put this in our kitchen. It connects great. The sound is good. Not as good as a real stereo system but OK for just background music.,1
"This radio is great when it will come in. It has very weak reception and it goes off as often as it plays. If you are on a straight road out away from the city, it might work, otherwise not so great.",1
"The keyboard is just that, a keyboard. Its got a magnetic connection into the bottom of the Surface Pro 4. However there are times when it just does not function. I'm not sure if this is a keyboard issue or a tablet issue but either way its a major PITA. Sometimes the keyboard will not work as soon as you connect it into the tablet. Sometimes it will just stop working mid typing session. Due to the amount of glitches I have experienced with the Surface Pro 4 I am inclined to believe it is a tablet problem. However, after replacing my Surface Pro 4 with a brand new one I still experience the same glitches with the keyboard. I will say I have not replaced the keyboard at all so I may just have a faulty product.",1
9 times out of 10 I have to press HELP to get the chosen activity functioning properly. This is my third remote from Logitech and I thought based on the price and the time passed since the first Harmony I had used that this one would function properly. No such luck. I would not recommend spending $250 on this thing.,1
the backpack doesn't have enough space to hold 2 lens and a camera and a flash for a photo session.,1
"Received this on December 16th and now the charger cradle will not charge this remote. I am not sure if it is the cradle or the remote, I am glad I waited to post a review on Amazon. This remote is not worth the high price if it is not charged !!!! I hope Logitech will resolve my issue with this remote. I will post back with any updates.",1
"My newly acquired XPS had to be repaired within one month of my purchase. Suddenly the Blue Sign appeared and my internet and sound were gone. Geek Squad couldn't tell me exactly what had happened. I just cross my fingers for this $1,200's investment.",1
It works okay except for when I turn the volume up it sounds like the sound backfeeds through the stereo is there a fix for this thank you,1
I'm giving it 3 stars as it wouldn't connect with my phone (galaxy S3) be aware it only works with some bluetooth systems. I wish I would have known this. The unit sounds great and my buddy could connect to it with his iPhone.,1
"The remote doesn't work well. It has locked up several times. Only putting it in the charger seemed to unstick it. Randomly sends signals. Does not turn off the TV most of the time. Not my first Logitech remote, but it is my last. Do not buy one of these monstrosities.",1
Bought this one on recommendation of a Best Buy employee. It fits tight and isn't adjustable. Took it back and bought A Bose night and day difference,1
Packaging and store employees did not know that a Firestick or Roku was needed to use this. Did not work well at all on a wireless network. Needs to be wired directly to cable. Store employees understood concept but had no idea what was required for implementation.,1
"Really disappointed after loving previous models like the Harmony One. Doesn't hold a charge very long, will stop sending out signals for no apparent reason, and the software seems more buggy than earlier versions.",1
"Have a rayzen 5, msi b350m bazooka motherboard and a rx580 4g video card. Did not boot up when installed. Remove one stick and it worked,switch and did not work. And the ram wasn't compatible with the motherboard/ CPU, crash randomly. I would not recommend for this specific set up",1
"I picked this type cover over the signature type cover due to the fingerprint support. I love the keyboard, but the fingerprint reader is useless. I have only been able to successfully unlock with it one time and even then it took multiple tries. I wish now that I had purchased the signature type cover but do not want to try to exchange it because I will need a keyboard in the mean time.",1
"The speaker provides great sound with a great boost to bass when chosen to use it. The strobe light on it gives it uniqueness and can be fun for gatherings. The light may be turned on and off easily as well as the option for extra bass. The downside I find with this speaker is that even when it is fully charged, that it does not maintain nearly as long as the box states it will last up to. The sound will get quiet and you will have to keep restarting it to keep the optimal volume. I have turned off the lights and the bass to see if there would be a noticeable difference and there was not. It is good for a 2-3 hour use, but don't expect to get much more than that. If the battery lasted longer I would definitely recommend it, but for the price paid with the lack of battery life I am unable to give this recommendation.",1
"I went into my local Best Buy and told the representative that I wanted to buy the ""Unicorn"" of headphones and he referred me to the Bowers and Wilkins P7 model. The sound is great; emphatic period.My experience is that they are difficult to adjust for long-term comfort on my head; they require a great deal of re-adjustment.The other disappointment is the frailty of the cords. I had to replace the one with the built-in mic after 7 months. Now the second one is beginning to fail.I don't know if B&W has realized this vulnerability but given the fact that they so readily offer replacements for $24.99 (at last check) it seems that they may. My failed cord was very easily replaced with proof of purchase which Best Buy's retail system faithfully provided.I've got another 14 months' of free replacements then I'll have to pay out of pocket if I wish to use that cord any longer.I regret buying them and would not had I had it to do again.",1
"The TV worked fine on day one. On day 2 the over the air tuner started to fail. The right side edge of the screen was distorted on every channel. The vendor denied the return since I they away the box. I offered to buy a new one, pay for the front, and return the defective one in new box. He rejected that deer because the new box would not match the serial number of the defective unit.",1
"Works with a lot of different equipment, but acts crazy alot of the time. If you turn on the tv with the oem remote, the Harmony won't turn it off when you hit the off button. still have to keep all of my old remotes close by because the harmony does't have all the functions on it. Also the battery runs down fast. If it wasn't free with my projector purchase , I would have taken it back.",1
"Decent sound, but comfort was a huge issue that eventually resulted in returning this item. More comfort with the Beats headphones- guess that's why they're more expensive.",1
I hoping this radio cicuit board is water sealed like they said cicuit board is exposed to elements .,1
"This is the second Harmony remote that I've owned (the first being a Harmony 880). Both had a one year warranty, and in the second year, both had physical buttons that started failing. On the 880, it was the Ch+ button. On the Ultimate, it is the DirectionRight button. I contacted customer support both times, but they just told me to buy a newer, more expensive model. This is a 200+ (at time of purchase) remote, that can't last more than 2 years. Just google these problems, and you'll see that a lot of people have the same problem eventually.",1
It did work but realized that I don't need it. Had a family member given me his account wireless and he just rebooted it. So I don't need the one I bought.,1
I wish the buttons on the screen were easier to use. I also have trouble holding the unit. It is slippery.,1
"I have this head unit mounted in a motorcycle fairing. Unfortunately, I also have experienced the issue with it randomly changing volume, depending on the vibration level (music and/or engine) of the fairing at any particular moment. Other than that, it's an excellent receiver with a tuner that locks in distant FM stations where others have failed (Kenwood KMRM312BT). I'll be trying the JVC KD-X33MBS this time around. Hopefully, the third time is the charm. I'm getting awfully tired of buying new stereos every six months....",1
"This is now my third Ultimate One, the previous ones both had problems with the battery failing after 15 -18 months (refuses to take a charge). Hopefully this one lasts a bit longer, if there was an alternative to this remote I would try it but nothing competes with the Ultimat in terms of features.",1
I am having all kinds of glitches. It rarely works like it should when you first turn it on.,1
"it is fast and seems to work ok, a little hard to use some of the swipe features",1
These look GREAT. I love the LED bar around the face. I am connected to the AUX in jack and to power all the time as it is at work..and it lowers the volume on its own during songs off and on all day...then it will power off for no apparent reason. I have 30 days to take it back and will be taking it in tomorrow.,1
"Logitech really dropped the ball here...beauty of the original Harmony One was the number of physical buttons and the button layout. The transport buttons were right where your thumb lives - perfect. Now, these button are the the top () and the number of buttons is reduced. Please...please Logitech - see the horrific error of your ways and bring back the layout of the original 'One'.",1
I loved harmony remotes this would have been my 3rd upgrade. Didn't like the feel or the functionality stick with the Harmony One.,1
"I was really disappointed with these headphones. When wired, with noise cancelling off, they sounded great. But, when you turn on the noise cancelling, you lose your highs, your volume, and the overall sound becomes, what I can only describe as, muddy. Go wireless, and the sound gets worse. There are very audible artifacts that MAY become white noise after a while, but for $300 headphones are unacceptable. Additionally, these phones can only be paired with one device at a time and the associated smartphone app is mediocre at best.I've owned a pair of Bose QC15s for some time and love them. While you do give up SOME sound quality with the NC (nature of the beast, I guess), the sound is fuller, richer than the JBLs. I guess I'll stick with wired for now.",1
This product was advertised as new but arrived used.,1
I can't get the clock to stay showing the time!!!!,1
"I was very excited to get this NC Bluetooth headphones, the sound and the Noise canceling are awesome. However, after 4 days of use, the headphones suddenly stopped and became unresponsive that I had to wait 8-10 hours for it to die down and charge it back again.Right after, it worked normally for a short time and it did the same thing again.I thought that this is a rare case of a defect. Went to Best Buy to exchange it, because this NC, Wireless and how it sounds blew away other headphones. However, after 8 days of use of the new headphone, it started to have the same problem again, went back to exchange it and same thing happened.Ultimately, got my refund back and won't buy it until JBL would fix this headphones software.",1
"Ergonomics and battery life are terrible. We frequently turn everything off trying to fast forward or rewind, pause or play. Battery life lasts a few days with little use. DO NOT BUY!",1
This remote is adequate. The buttons are small . I have to press help a lot to get it on the right switch in the amp. But it does work and for the price it is worth it.,1
"I bought these on the recommendation of the store salesman, sounded pretty good in a the store, however they didn't have a lot of bass when I hooked them up. I exchanged them for another brand same price range and they were great!",1
Doesnt come with remote hub remote needs to be in vicinity of ir,1
"Recommended by an associate, the speaker was inticing and I liked how many connections it could make (WiFi, Aux, Bluetooth, USB) - but configuring the unit and working with the web interface and the iOS software has been a nightmare. On top of that, the sound quality is not worth the price at all.",1
I installed this on a PC with Windows 10 64 bit. It would connect and then disconnect from my router over and over. I ended up returning it to Best Buy.,1
"!!!!!DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A MAC!!!!!silverlight and harmony plugins are CLEARLY NOT production ready. WILL NOT SYNC!!! tried different macs, different OS', etc.i have an apple tattoo and have been using logitech for years. not anymore. and my friends at CNET will be hearing about this shortly.oh, and i almost forgot to mention. the ONLY tech support option besides the user forums is a 29 an hour waste of time trying to troubleshoot the silverlight plugin.",1
"I was excited to use this device, as it was to reduce remote clutter on my end table. Also, reduce stress for my wife in what remote does what. Setup account, created 3 tasks. In a perfect world, line of sight would always be available. Significant other would actually turn off all the Home Theater devices in use. When I push ""Watch TV"", some of the devices may turn on, then everything is out of sync and have to turn each device to same power state, and try again. The other buttons needed on this device is DVR 30 sec skip forward; 10 sec rewind. I have to revert back to DVR remote for this function to skip through commercials (as I was typing this - there may be a way to create this function- don't know how). When I am able to spend more time I will try to figure out, as I am past the return date.",1
Good Keyboard and addition to the Surface Pro platform if you desire fingerprint scanner access. For my use the Surface Pro Keyboard without fingerprint scanner works just fine.,1
"I have multiple Harmony remotes. My favorite remains my first, the Harmony One. Although more powerful in terms of customization than my Harmony Smart Remote(s), it is much more awkward in its button layout.",1
"I bought a previous Sling product because Best Buy said it supported Mac/Windows (like this one says). Used it for a while with my laptop on trips--worked fine--until Sling decided they would no longer support Vista. There was NO warning about this when I paid for it. Now I have a ridiculously expensive paper weight unless I buy a whole new laptop that I don't need. I expect Windows 7 support will be next to go away. I wouldn't even be concerned if I simply couldn't call in for support--no--it just doesn't work at all--check the internet (including their own site) for all kinds of disgruntled customers in the same boat. Unless you plan on throwing away money by continuously updating equipment and operating systems that you don't need, plan on this being obsolete as soon as Microsoft comes out with another operating system or two. (And that is only if you have Windows 10 now; if you have Windows 7 or 8, it will useless be sooner.) No more Sling products for me. Very poor recognition of customer needs.",1
"The touch screen was not user friendly in my opinion. I love the Logitech line, but this one was not for me.",1
"The stereo was good, except the hands free didn't work well in my car, my car is loud and caused the hands free calling useless",1
"Audio jack is broke, tweeter is sunken into the box. Scratches on case. Item not as described.",1
Everyone in my family hates this new harmony remote. We love our Harmony One up in the kids playroom but the Ultimate is the ultimate disappointment. It is not well balanced in hand. It defaults to screens we don't want on the touch screen. It requires 2 hands since it is so out of balance that touching some of the buttons feels really wonky. Do not buy one of these. A used or refurbed Harmony One would be much better. I think the guys who designed this were too in love with their Android phones and wanted to create a similar feel but it stinks. I fail to find a way to make it start on the screen we want. I've actually had to threaten my kids with punishment if they bring up how much they hate this one.,1
"Of all the Harmony remotes that I've owned over the years, this is by far my least favorite.Weaknesses:Lack of physical number buttons (This is of course a design choice by Harmony. I just don't like it)Lack of IR spread - This remote must be pointed directly at the devices you're trying to controlSlowness - Takes a long time to turn all the devices on. This used to be a configurable setting in the old software.Software usability - Compared to the old harmony software, the new version is watered down regarding functionality and lacks usability / intuitiveness.Operational issues - I have to hard reset this thing once a week or so because the screen stops turning offStrengths:Controls all my IR devicesPrice was good as I got it on saleI'll look elsewhere when it comes time to replace this.Harmony remotes I've owned in the past for various family members / locations. Of all of these, this is the worst:Harmony 1 - The best by farHarmony Touch - Very similar to the Ultimate in feel but works way better.Harmony 700 - Solid and affordableHarmony 880 - Great remote until the dog got itThere's another silver version that I haven't had to mess with in so long I even forget the model .",1
I specifically searched RF remote and this is what came up. IT IS NOT AN RF REMOTE AND WILL ONLY CONTROL DEVICES IT IS POINTED AT!!!,1
"I recieved this XB30, in exchange for my honest review...Not impressed with the sound from this bluetooth speaker. It has a Bassy & Dull sound to it! For 150.00, it Lacks Highs badly... For example, I have a 40.00 Phillips bluetooth speaker ( SBT300), that plays Clearer than this Sony. Also, the 40.00 Phillips, is 3x larger than this SRS-XB30 Sony! While the Sony has decent Bass, it truely lacks High frequencies. Highs, come across muddy.If you like Bass, and leds, this bluetooth speaker module is for you. If you like clear high frequencies, as I do. I reccommend skipping this, Id rather have better performing Speakers, vs the flashing and color changing leds!I do like that rhis has a rechargable battery, built in. You can also plug your phone or mp3 player directly into this for audio, via 3.5mm adapter. As well as charging, via supplied usb rear input.",1
Bought it for my bf for valentine's day and he is having (still 3 months later) a great deal of problems connecting it to his TV. Might be too advanced for some TVs so beware of this when purchasing it.,1
"I will start off by saying, I am using this speaker to play music in my office. The speaker sounds great at low volumes, but tends to distort and sound a little tinny at higher volumes. If this speaker were around $!50, it would probably be a 4 or 5 star for me, but for $300, I come to expect more. Fortunately, I got it open box so got a bit of a discount. The SongPal app is terrible as well.",1
Nothing special about these speakers other than the brand.It sounded like my set of stock pioneer on a 03 civic SI.,1
"I purchased this to replace my Harmony one, which I loved. This remote was more expensive and vastly inferior. The ergonomics are terrible. The remote cannot be operated effectively with one hand. To reach the hard buttons at the top, one invariably activates the touch screen by mistake. In general, there are too few hard buttons (like HELP) requiring you to look down at the touch screen unnecessarily. In addition, the touch screen is not sensitive enough and frequently does not recognize taps. The swipe feature (which is nice in theory) is also not sensitive and often requires do-overs. After 4 months of babying (i.e., not letting the kids use it), the top half of the touch screen no longer worked at all. Subsequently found out that free technical support in the US is only available for 90 days (unlike Europe and Asia, which have 2 years and 1 year free phone support respectively). Without technical support, I was close to returning this, but with a little self-help persistence on the website, I was able to figure out how to reboot it (which solved the problem). Still, it should not have to be this difficult. Charging for technical support during the warranty period is a poor business model. Hope this company gets its act back together.",1
After 1 hour using it feels like they were crushing my ears....also equalizer app needs improvements,1
"Half the time the soundbar doesn't turn on, and I have to use the help function. Aso, I have to sect the Blu-ray player to operate it, even though I slected Watch Movie. Not worth the hefty price tag. Also, very glitchy and stuff will just turn off if you touch the touchpad by accident.",1
The bass and treble levels were not distinct. My iPhone sounded just as good,1
"The product is bulky, the equipment they have to connect it to your car is ridiculous and doesn't work. takes up tons of dash space. Do you like wires running through your car that is what you will get as well. Want to hook it up via Bluetooth or USB, nope only 90's technology works here. can connect it via fm radio (although the transmitter sucks so sound quality is horrible) or aux (headphone) jack, quality also sucks. Don't waste your time.",1
"This is my third Logitech Harmony unit and my last. My original was quite good although developed issues. When it finally gave up the ghost I replaced it with the next version which had a touch screen and resolved the issues of the original. Unfortunately, that one was destroyed by water damage after a burst pipe. I replaced it with the Harmony Ultimate One and it is absolutely horrible. The ergonomics are horrendous, it is difficult to use some of the most common buttons without physical gyrations or using two hands. In addition, the touch screen is so sensitive that you are constantly activating things you don't want.I switched to a new provider (went from cable to satellite) and the Logitech does not fully support the new device including the fact that it won't bring up the numeric pad on the touch screen) to enter a channel. This means that I still have to resort to the satellite box remote to easily control the box.The topper is that after just a little over a year (just enough time for the warranty to run out) the Off button no longer works which now makes the remote control completely useless.Just not worth the hassle. I truly believe that Logitech should develop a new remote that fixes these problems and give one, free of charge, to anyone that bought the Ultimate One. It's that bad.",1
Don't like the shape - it makes it bottom heavy. The off/FF/rewind/play buttons being at the top of the remote make it awkward to use.,1
"Item was purchased as a gift and intended to be used day of celebration. A 2 year old could have opened my item the way it was when i got it. The items box was teared, soiled and barely recognizable. The worst part of it all it was that it was a completely different used version of the item I originally purchased. Very disappointing. Received a full refund.",1
"Unboxed it and got it connected to wifi pretty easily using WPS. Tried installing the software on one computer, but it froze up after installing and running. Tried installing on another computer and got a little further - it did see the Slingbox on the network. I got about halfway into configuring it but it hung up at the point where it was trying to configure the remote. Uninstalled the software, did a hard reset on the Slingbox, reconnected it to the wifi, tried again and it hung up in the same spot. Tried installing the Sligbox app on my Android tablet, thinking that might get further... alas, you can't configure the slingbox that way - you can only use it once it's already configured. At that point, I'd spent an hour of my life on this silly thing so I gave up and returned it.",1
"First, some background. I went into the store to buy this computer a couple of weeks before and it rose in price by $70 overnight and then another $30 within a couple of days. I decided on a different computer (an iBuyPower) instead. Less that two weeks later, the Dell was on sale for $200 off, or $100 less than I was originally going to pay, so I packed up the other one and returned it in exchange for the Dell and a savings of $250!However, when I got it home it was immediately evident that this was a slow computer despite its reasonably high specifications. It also had a habit of randomly shutting down and/or rebooting for no reason. Now I'm a computer engineer, so I know the difference between a system reboot and a random one and this was no system reboot!Back it went and I got the original iBuyPower which not only has an SSD (which ALL computers of this spec should have, but a better graphics card and comparative blazing speed - oh, and as a bonus, no unnecessary bloatware!",1
"Can only stream so much data, I'm only able to use it a week at its full potential",1
It straight up didn't work. Would not recommend. It had decent bass but that was only when the speakers work. Go ahead and spend $20 more to get something much nicer and reliable.,1
"When I was listening to these in the store they sounded great. When I was listening to these at home, they fell a little flat in comparison. My guess is that demo mode was much louder but ultimately I wanted more from them. They have a great sound and I like the lights associated. Solid speakers but I'd recommend bose or jbl before these.",1
It was ok didn't like it as much as I thought I would,1
"I purchased this keyboard to go with my fantastic Surface Pro4, the high end one. For the money this keyboard is poor quality, so rather than go for this keyboard, my advice is go for the one with the finger print reader, same price, better quality and functions. alas I still have mine, however I purchased the fingerprint one now but have this gray one doing nothing.",1
When changing channels Does not respond quick when pushing buttons have to press many times to get the command you want.,1
This product is a horrible! I have owned them for slightly more than a year and used less than 100 hours. There is no audio coming out of the right side. I have tried using with 3 different devices both wired and via Bluetooth. All with the same result. The companies customer service (stifling a laugh) is on par with Comcast. The one star rating was a gift.,1
"I got it as a free replacement for a Harmony One that had an exploding battery. I thought great they are standing behind their product when I accepted it, but this is horrible. It's an ergonomic disaster. It actually takes two hands AND two eyes to use because it's so badly laid out. I don't get why they created two sets of buttons separated by the touch screen. I like the bottom feel and curve of the remote, but the top edges are too sharp and the nice fit to my palm is defeated by the fact that I need to move the remote up and down so I can reach the buttons. And I have pretty long fingers. Seriously, this is so awkward I don't think I'll use it much.2/11/15 UpdateDropped to 1 star as the product has a design defect. I noticed that the remote makes a fairly loud buzz when the backlight is on. So I called Logitech and their first response was to show me how to turn the button highlight off. That did work, but then you cannot see the buttons in the dark. Clearly this was a known issue. I kept saying that I wanted the backlight to work. After a few minutes delay she told me it was a known defect that engineering was working on. She would put my name on a list for replacement when they figured it out. I asked her to keep the ticket open until I received the replacement. She said OK. I repeated this again before hanging up and she said OK again. 2 minutes after hanging up I get an email that says since I've put your name on the list I'm closing this ticket. She could have told me the truth when I had her on the phone. Sigh. Cannot recommend this remote until they figure out their design flaw. My hearing is not great and it didn't really bother me that much, but my kids don't want to use it because the noise is so annoying.9/22/2015 UpdateEventually I contacted them again about the noise and they did send me a new remote that fixed the noise problem. So I changed this back to 2 stars. The remote is functional and it looks good, but where the original One was a joy to use this is still and ergonomic disaster.",1
My computer continues to crash not sure why but didn't happen before.,1
Don't buy this product is so cheaply made u can't do nothing with it.Not worth a penny.,1
The only downside is the short distance that you have to maintain between the music source a the speaker.,1
"Having trouble turning it in on. Geek Squad helped but it still doesn't want to turn on the next day, after being shut off over night. Have to make an appointment at Best Buy to see what's wrong!",1
good,1
